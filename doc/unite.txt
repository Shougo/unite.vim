INTRODUCTION					*unite-introduction*

*unite* or *unite.vim* searches and displays information from arbitrary sources
like files, buffers, recently used files or registers. You can run one of
defined actions on a target displayed.

The differences between |unite| and similar plugins like |fuzzyfinder| or |ku|
are that |unite| doesn't use the built-in completion interface of Vim, and
integrates sources at the same time.

==============================================================================
USAGE						*unite-usage*

	In case when you run with files and buffers as the source
>
	:Unite file buffer
<

	In case when you run with the initial input value foo
>
	:Unite -input=foo file
<

The unite you started splits the window horizontally by default, opening on
the top of the Vim.  For example,
>
	:Unite file
<
lists up the files in the current directory.  You may choose one of the
candidates by moving j or k, and typing Enter key opens the candidate in a new
buffer.  That's the default action for candidates of which the kind is file.
You may also select an action with <Tab> on a candidate.  See also
|unite-action| about the actions.

You can narrow down the candidates with a keyword.  After opening a unite
window, the cursor goes on the right side of > in the 2nd line by typing i.
Then you can input a keyword to narrow down the candidates.  Each single
characters you type narrows down the candidates.  You can also use a wild
card * as an arbitrary character sequence.  For example
>
	*hisa
<
matches hisa, ujihisa, or ujihisahisa.  Furthermore, two consequence wild cards
matches directory recursively.  For example
>
	**/foo
<
matches bar/foo or buzz/bar/foo.  Note that you should consider using
|file_rec| in most cases that will be described bellow.

You may specify multiple keywords to narrow down, separating by spaces.
>
	foo bar
<
That matches candidates that meet both foo and bar.

OR matching is implemented by "|".
>
	foo|bar
<
You may specify negative conditions with !.
>
	foo !bar
<
That matches candidates that meet foo but doesn't meet bar.

	Wild cards are added automatically with / if you specify files on
	-buffer-name option.  That's handy in case you select file with unite.
>
	:Unite -buffer-name=files file
<
See also |unite_default_key_mappings| for other actions.

Screencast is available. Thanks ujihisa!

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*unite-install*

Install the distributed files into Vim script directory which is usually
~/.vim/, or $HOME/vimfiles on Windows.

In future VimJolts the Vim plugin package manager will support unite, you can
install unite just by `jolt install unite`.

You may run unite with |:Unite| command with source as parameters if you
succeeded in installing unite.  However, it's a pain in the ass to run the
command explicitly every time, so I recommend you to set a key mapping for the
command.

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*unite-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*unite-commands*

:Unite [{options}] {sources}			*:Unite*
		Shows the candidate window of {sources} with the initial
		narrowing text empty.  You may specify multiple {sources} with
		spaces as a separator; the order of the {sources} is equal to
		the order of candidates.  See also |unite-source| for sources.
		This command restores previous position.

		In case you are already on a unite buffer, the narrowing text
		is stored.

		You may give a list of strings, separating with ":", after
		the name of sources. You must escape ":" and "\" with "\"
		in parameters themselves. "::" is abbreviation argument. It
		depends on the sources how the parameters are interpreted.

		Examples:
		"file:foo:bar": the parameters of source file are
		                ["foo", "bar"].
		"file:foo\:bar": the parameter of source file is
		                ["foo:bar"].
		"file:foo::baz": the parameters of source file are
		                ["foo", "", "bar"].

						*unite-options*
		{options} are options for a unite buffer.  You may give the
		following parameters for a option; you must escape with "\"
		when it contains spaces.

						*unite-options-buffer-name*
		-buffer-name={buffer-name}
		Specifies a buffer name. You can share the configuration of
		functions like |unite#set_substitute_pattern()| by giving the
		same name to unite buffers that have the same purpose.  The
		default buffer name is 'default'.
		Note: Buffer name must not contain any spaces.

						*unite-options-input*
		-input={input-text}
		Specifies an initial narrowing text. The default value is ''.

						*unite-options-prompt*
		-prompt={prompt-text}
		Specifies a prompt. The default value is '> '.

						*unite-options-default-action*
		-default-action={default-action}
		Specifies a default action. The default value is 'default'.

						*unite-options-start-insert*
						*unite-options-no-start-insert*

		|g:unite_enable_start_insert| option.
		The behavior is undefined when both options are defined.

						*unite-options-no-quit*
		-no-quit
		Doesn't close unite buffer after firing an action.  Unless you
		specify it, a unite buffer gets closed when you selected an
		action which is "is_quit".

		Specifies the width of a unite buffer.  Unless you specify
		it, |g:unite_winwidth| is used.

						*unite-options-winheight*
		-winheight={window-height}
		Specifies the height of a unite buffer.  Unless you specify
		it, |g:unite_winheight| is used.

						*unite-options-immediately*
		-immediately
		If the number of candidates is exactly one, it runs default
		action immediately. If candidate is empty, it doesn't open any
		unite buffer. This option also works in the narrowing mode.

						*unite-options-no-empty*
		-no-empty
		If candidate is empty, it doesn't open any unite buffer.

						*unite-options-auto-preview*
		-auto-preview
		When you selected a candidate, it runs "preview" action
		automatically.

						*unite-options-completion*
		-completion
		Uses unite completion interface. |unite-options-col| is also
		required.

						*unite-options-col*
		-col={column-number}
		Specifies the called unite buffer position.

						*unite-options-vertical*
		-vertical
		Splits unite window vertically.

						*unite-options-horizontal*
		-horizontal
		Splits unite window horizontally.
		
		When both options are undefined, it depends on
		|g:unite_enable_split_vertically| option.
		The behavior is undefined when both options are defined.

						*unite-options-direction*
		-direction={direction}
		Defines split position rule. The default value is the same to
		|g:unite_split_rule|.

						*unite-options-no-split*

FUNCTIONS					*unite-functions*

CORE						*unite-functions-core*

unite#get_kinds([{kind-name}])			*unite#get_kinds()*
		Gets the kinds of {kind-name}.  Unless they exist, this
		returns an empty dictionary.  This returns a dictionary of
		that keys are kind names and values are the kinds when you
		skip giving {kind-name}.

		Note: Changing the return value is not allowed.

unite#get_sources([{source-name}])		*unite#get_sources()*
		Gets the loaded source of {source-name}. Unless they exist,
		this returns an empty dictionary.  This returns a dictionary
		of that keys are source names and values are the sources when
		you skip giving {source-name}.  If you give {source-name} as
		dictionary, unite.vim use this source temporary.

		Note: Changing the return value is not allowed.

CUSTOMS						*unite-functions-customs*

unite#start({sources}, [, {context}])		*unite#start()*
		Creates a new Unite buffer.  In case when you are already on a
		Unite buffer, the narrowing text is preserved.

		{sources} is a list of which elements are formatted as
		{source-name} or [{source-name}, {args}, ...].  You may
		specify multiple string arguments for {args} of {source-name}.

		Refer |unite-notation-{context}| about {context}.  If you
		skip a value, it uses the default value.

unite#start_complete({sources}, [{context}])	*unite#start_complete()*
		Returns the key sequence that opens unite buffer for
		completion.  This will be used with inoremap <buffer><expr>
		usually.
		Example:
>
		inoremap <buffer><expr> <C-l> unite#start_complete(
		\ ['vimshell/history'], {
		\ 'start_insert' : 0,
		\ 'input' : vimshell#get_cur_text()})
<
unite#get_candidates({sources}, [, {context}])	*unite#get_candidates()*
		Get a list of all candidates of sources. Unite buffer is not
		created.  This function may not work in some sources. The
		arguments feature is same to |unite#start()|.
		Note: max_candidates option of sources is ignored.

unite#do_candidates_action({action-name}, {candidates}, [, {context}])
						*unite#do_candidates_action()*
		Does {action-name} with {candidates}. Unite buffer is not
		created.  This function may not work in some actions.
		Note: To get candidates, use |unite#get_candidates()|.

unite#get_context()				*unite#get_context()*
		Gets the context information of the current Unite buffer.
		This is used by functions like |unite#custom_action()| to call
		|unite#start()| internally.

unite#do_action({action-name})			*unite#do_action()*
		Returns the key sequence for running {action-name} action to
		the marked candidates.  This function works only when Unite
		has been already activated.  This causes a runtime error if
		{action-name} doesn't exist or the action is invalid.

		This is handy for defining a key mapping to run an action.

		This runs the default action when you specify "default" for
		{action-name}.

		This runs an action on the candidates of the current line or
		the top of the candidates when none of the candidates are
		marked.

		This is usually used as inoremap <buffer><expr> or
		nnoremap <buffer><expr>.  For example,
>
		nnoremap <silent><buffer><expr> <C-k> unite#do_action('preview')
>
unite#smart_map({narrow-map}, {select-map})	*unite#smart_map()*
		Returns the key sequence which works both modes of narrowing
		and selecting with respect to the given narrow-map and
		select-map.  Use this with |unite#do_action()|.  This will be
		used with inoremap <buffer><expr> or nnoremap <buffer><expr>
		usually.
		Example:
>
		inoremap <buffer><expr> ' unite#smart_map("'", unite#do_action('preview'))
<
unite#mappings#set_current_filters({filters})
					*unite#mappings#set_current_filters()*
		Changes current unite buffer filters.
		Example:
>
  nnoremap <buffer><expr> S      unite#mappings#set_current_filters(
        \ empty(unite#mappings#get_current_filters()) ? ['sorter_reverse'] : [])
<
unite#mappings#get_current_filters()
					*unite#mappings#get_current_filters()*
		Gets current unite buffer filters.

unite#set_substitute_pattern({profile-name}, {pattern}, {subst} [, {priority}])
						*unite#set_substitute_pattern()*
		Specifies a replace pattern of narrowing text for a Unite
		buffer of which name is {profile-name}.  "" is regarded as
		"default" and is equivalent to the case of |:Unite| without
		-buffer-name= option.  You may specify multiple {profile-name}
		with breaking with ",".  {pattern} is the replace target regexp
		and {subst} is the substitute string.  If you specify a same
		{pattern} again, the setting is just updated.  You may
		defeat {pattern} with giving "" to {subst}.  {priority}
		prioritizes how this replaces.  If you skipped giving
		{priority} it is 0.  Give bigger number for a {pattern}
		which must be done earlier.
		Note: that the initial text of Unite buffer is not replaced
		with these values.

		You may mimic ambiguous matching with using this function.
>
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '[^*]\ze[[:alnum:]]', '\0*', 100)
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '[[:alnum:]]', ' \0', 100)
<
		The former does ambiguous search within "/" while the latter
		does over it.

		The initial value is defined as the following; on a buffer of
		which profile_name is files, it adds a wildcard in order to
		match ~ as $HOME and to match "/" partially.
>
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '^\~',
		\ substitute(unite#util#substitute_path_separator($HOME), ' ', '\\\\ ', 'g'), -100)
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '[^~.*]\ze/', '\0*', 100)
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '/\ze[^~.*]', '/*', 100)
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '\.', '*.', 1000)
<
		If {subst} is a list, Unite searches by some narrowing texts.
		Note: It is only once to be replaced with a list.
>
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '^\.v/',
		\ [expand('~/.vim/'), unite#util#substitute_path_separator($HOME) . '/.bundle/*/'], 1000)
<
unite#get_substitute_pattern({profile-name})
						*unite#get_substitute_pattern()*
		Gets the substitute pattern for narrowing text of a Unite
		buffer name {profile-name}.  This causes an error without the
		substitute pattern of {profile-name}.  This is for debugging.

unite#set_profile({profile-name}, {option-name}, {value})
						*unite#set_profile()*
		Set {profile-name} specialized {option-name} to {value}.
		
		These options below are available:
		
		substitute_patterns		(Dictionary)
		Specifies substitute patterns. The key is "pattern",
		"subst" and "priority". Please refer to
		|unite#set_substitute_pattern()|.
		
		filters				(List)
		Specifies a list of filter names. The filters are called after
		combining all candidates. If you change filters dynamically,
		use |unite#mappings#set_current_filters()| instead.
		
		ignorecase			(Number)
		Specifies 'ignorecase' value in unite buffer. If it is
		omitted, global 'ignorecase' value is used.
		Note: If profile_name is "files", the default value "1" is
		used.
		
		smartcase			(Number)
		Specifies 'smartcase' value in unite buffer. If it is omitted,
		global 'smartcase' value is used:e.
		Note: If profile_name is "files", the default value "0" is
		used.

unite#set_buffer_name_option({buffer-name}, {option-name}, {value})
					*unite#set_buffer_name_option()*
		This function is deprecated. Please use
		|unite#set_profile()| instead.

unite#custom_default_action({kind}, {default-action})
					*unite#custom_default_action()*
		Changes the default action of {kind} into {default-action}.
		You may specify multiple {kind} with separating ",".  For
		example:
>
		call unite#custom_default_action('file', 'tabopen')
<
unite#custom_action({kind}, {name}, {action})
						*unite#custom_action()*
		Adds an {action} of which name is {name} for {kind}.
		You may specify multiple {kind} with separating ",".  For
		example:
>
		let my_tabopen = {
		\ 'is_selectable' : 1,
		\ }
		function! my_tabopen.func(candidates)
		  call unite#take_action('tabopen', a:candidates)
		
		  let dir = isdirectory(a:candidate.word) ?
		  \    a:candidate.word : fnamemodify(a:candidate.word, ':p:h')
		  execute g:unite_kind_openable_lcd_command '`=dir`'
		endfunction
		call unite#custom_action('file,buffer', 'tabopen', my_tabopen)
		unlet my_tabopen
<
unite#undef_custom_action({kind}, {name})	*unite#undef_custom_action()*
		Deletes an action of which name is {name} of {kind} that you
		added with using |unite#custom_action()|.  You may specify
		multiple {kind} with separating ",".  This function doesn't do
		anything if the function doesn't exist.

unite#custom_alias({kind}, {name}, {action})
						*unite#custom_alias()*
		Defines an action of {name} which is another name of {action}
		in {kind}.  You may specify multiple {kind} with separating
		",".  If {action} is "nop", such action is disabled.
		example:
>
		call unite#custom_alias('file', 'h', 'left')
<
unite#custom_filters({source-name}, {filters})	*unite#custom_filters()*
		Changes the filters of {source-name} into {filters}. You
		may specify multiple sources with separating "," in
		{source-name}.  {filters} is a name of filter or a list of
		the names.
		Note: This function is deprecated. Please use
		|unite#custom_source()| instead.

unite#custom_max_candidates({source-name}, {max})
					*unite#custom_max_candidates()*
		Changes the max candidates of {source-name} into
		{max}.  You may specify multiple sources with
		separating "," in {source-name}.
		Note: This function is deprecated. Please use
		|unite#custom_source()| instead.

unite#custom_source({source-name}, {option-name}, {value})
						*unite#custom_source()*
		Set {source-name} source specialized {option-name}
		to {value}.
		
		These options below are available:
		
		filters				(List)
		Specifies a list of filter names.  The filters overwrite
		source default filters.
		
		max_candidates			(Number)
		Changes the max candidates into {value}.  If {value}
		is 0, all candidates is displayed.
		
		ignore_pattern			(String)
		Specifies the regexp pattern to ignore candidates
		of the source.  This applies on the word attribute
		of candidates.  Regardless of |g:unite_enable_ignore_case|
		value, it's case sensitive.

unite#take_action({action-name}, {candidate})
						*unite#take_action()*
		Runs an action {action-name} against {candidate}.  This will
		be mainly used in |unite#custom_action()|.  When the action is
		is_selectable, the {candidate} will be automatically converted
		into a list.

unite#take_parents_action({action-name}, {candidate}, {extend-candidate})
						*unite#take_parents_action()*
		Same to |unite#take_action()| but searches the parents' action
		table with combining {extend-candidate} on {candidate}.  This
		is handy for reusing parents' actions.

unite#define_source({source})			*unite#define_source()*

				The number of the tab

						*unite-kind-directory*
directory	An interface for directories.  This kind inherits file,
		this requires keys it requires.

			word			(String)	(Required)
				The string you want to insert

						*unite-kind-jump_list*
jump_list	An interface for jump lists.  This kind inherits openable,
		so this requires that it requires.
		Note: The action__path or action__buffer_nr is required.

			action__path		(String)	(Required)
				The path of the file that you'll jump into.

			action__buffer_nr	(String)	(Required)
				The buffer number of the buffer that you'll

				where you'll jump into only by the pattern of
				action__pattern and action__line, a unique
				String to distinguish lines that match same
				pattern.

		About action__signature and calc_signature() function

		A source which specifies action__signature must define
		cals_signatre() function for calculating the signature by the
		line number of the buffer.  calc_signature() receives {lnum}
		as the first argument and returns a signature in String, where
		{lnum} is a line number.  jump_list compares signatures with
		calling this function.

		The below is an example.
>
		function! s:source.calc_signature(lnum)
		  let range = 2
		  let from = max([1, a:lnum - range])
		  let to   = min([a:lnum + range, line('$')])

CREATE SOURCE					*unite-create-source*

The files in autoload/unite/sources are automatically loaded and it
calls unite#sources#{source_name}#define() whose return value is the
source.  Each return value can be a list so you can return an empty list
to avoid adding undesireble sources.  To add your own sources
dynamically, you can use |unite#define_source()|.

Note: To optimize load source files, if "buffer/rec" source name is detected,
unite.vim loads "autoload/unite/sources/buffer*.vim" files.  The source file
name must have source name prefix(Ex: buffer).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOURCE ATTRIBUTES				*unite-source-attributes*

						*unite-source-attribute-name*
name			String		(Required)
			The name of a source.  It must consist of the
			following characters:
			- a-z
			- 0-9
			- _
			- /

			For example:
			- "buffer" , "file_mru" and "virw/git" are
			  valid.
			- "BadOne", "!@#$%^&*()_[]{}-|" and "" are
			  invalid.

				*unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates*
gather_candidates	Function	(Required)
			This function is called once in gathering
			candidates and anytime in redrawing by
			|<Plug>(unite_redraw).  If source is defined as
			|unite-source-is_volatile|, this function is
			called whenever the input string is changed.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameter and returns a list of {candidate}.
			Here, {args} is a list of parameters given to
			the source when |:Unite| command is executed
			and {context} is the context informantion when
			the source is called.  If either of these are not
			given, the argument becomes "".  Hence, this
			function must handle empty string.  Arguments
			should be checked by |get()| function.  For more
			details, you can refer to
			|unite-notation-{context}| about {context} and
			|unite-notation-{candidate}| about {candidate}.
			This attribute can be omitted if other
			attributes can gather some candidates.
			The candidates gathered by this attribute are
			cached by unite buffer.  The cache is available
			until the unite buffer is closed and is
			discarded unless you use |:UniteResume|.  To
			cache persistenly regardless of the life of the
			unite buffer, you have some source to save the
			cache on non-volatile storage.

				*unite-source-attribute-change_candidates*
change_candidates	Function	(Optional)
			This function is called if the input string is
			changed in gathering candidates by unite.  You
			can make use of this attribute to generate
			candidates from the input string.  The
			candidates generated by this attributes are
			added to the candidates cached by
			|unites-source-attribute-gather_candidates|.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameter and returns a list of {candidate}.
			The specification of the parameters and the
			returned value is same as
			|unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates|.

			*unite-source-attribute-async_gather_candidates*
async_gather_candidates	Function	(Optional)
			This function is called asynchronously in
			gathering candidates.  You can make use of this
			function to split time-consuming job into small
			jobs.  |g:unite_update_time| is the default
			timing.  This function takes {args} and
			{context} as its parameter and returns a list of
			{candidate}.
			
			The specification of the parameters and the
			returned value is same as
			|unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates|.

					*unite-source-attribute-complete*
complete		Function	(Optional)
			This functions is called to complete the source
			argument of |:Unite|.  This function takes
			{args}, {context}, {arglead}, {cmdline} and
			{cursorpos} as its parameter and returns a list
			of candidates.

						*unite-source-attribute-hooks*
hooks			Dictionary		(Optional)
			You may put hook functions in this dictionary
			in which the key is the position to hook and
			and the value is the reference to the function
			to be called.  The following hook functions are
			defined:

			on_init		*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_init*
			Called just before returning to unite buffer
			after executing |:Unite| commands or calling
			|unite#start()| but executing |:UniteResume|.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameters.
			Note that you must be careful to select the
			function to call because the unite buffer is not
			still initialized in calling this hook
			function.

			on_syntax
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_syntax*
			Called after the unite buffer is initialized and
			syntax for each source is set but not called if
			|unite-source-attribute-syntax| is not set.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameters.
			Highlight configuration for each source is done
			by this function.

			Note: To get abbr head column, use
			"unite#get_current_unite().abbr_head".
			Example:
>
			syntax match uniteSource_FileMru_Time /(.*)/ contained containedin=uniteSource_FileMru
			highlight default link uniteSource_FileMru_Time Statement
<
			Note you must set the containedin of the same syntax
			name as for |unite-source-attribute-syntax|.

			on_close
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_close*
			Called after executing |<Plug>(unite_exit)| or
			closing the unite buffer following some command
			execution.  This function takes {args} and
			{context} as its parameters.

			on_pre_filter
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_pre_filter*
			Called before the filters to narrow down the
			candidates. This function takes {args} and
			{context} as its parameters.

			on_post_filter
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_post_filter*
			Called after the filters to narrow down the
			candidates.  This is used to set attributes.
			This filters is to avoid adversely affecting the
			performance.  This function takes {args} and
			{context} as its parameters.

			on_pre_init
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_pre_init*
			Called before source is initialized.
			{args} is empty.
			Current source is set as "a:context.source" in
			{context}.
			You can dynamically initialize source by
			changing "a:context.source" in this function.

					*unite-source-attribute-action_table*
action_table		Dictionary		(Optional)
			Adds source's own action table.  In this
			dictionary, the key is the kind and the value is
			the action table.  The specification of action
			table is same as
			|unite-kind-attribute-action_table|.  With this
			dictionary, you can define original
			|unite-kind-attribute-action_table| for each
			kind in source's own context.
			For example:
>
			'action_table' : { 'buffer' : foo_action_table }
<
			means that foo_action_table is used for kind
			"buffer" in this source's context.
			You can use "*" for the key to match any kind.
			This is useful if you expect only one kind.  If
			no key-value pair is set, this dictionary is
			left empty.  You can put action table without a
			corresponding key and it means the key is "*".
			For example, the following two are the same.
>
			'action_table' : foo_action_table
			'action_table' : { '*' : foo_action_table }
<
					*unite-source-attribute-default_action*
default_action		Dictionary		(Optional)
			Adds default action unique to the source.  In
			this dictionary, the key is the kind and the value
			is the default action.
			If it's not given, the kind's default action is used.
			The default action can be in string format and
			it means the same as:
>
			'default_action' : { '*' : action_name}.
<
					*unite-source-attribute-alias_table*
alias_table		Dictionary		(Optional)
			Adds an alias table unique to the source.  In
			this dictionary, the key is the kind and the
			value is the alias table.
			If the key is '*', it matches any kinds.
			Please refer to
			|unite-kind-attribute-action_table| for the
			specification of alias table.
			If no key-value is set, this dictionary is left
			empty.

					*unite-source-attribute-max_candidates*
max_candidates		Number		(Optional)
			The maximum number of candidates.

			This attribute is optional; if it is not given,
			0 is used as the default value.  This means
			maximum number is infinity.

			*unite-source-attribute-required_pattern_length*
required_pattern_length	Number		(Optional)
			The least string length to narrow down the
			candidates.  This attribute is optional.
			If it's not given, 0 is used as the default value and
			all the possible candidates are collected.

					*unite-source-attribute-is_volatile*
is_volatile		Number		(Optional)
			Whether the source recalculates the candidates
			everytime the input is changed.
			This attribute is optional.
			If it's not given, 0 is set as the default value. In
			this case, canidates are cached in unite buffer
			and it does not call
			|unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates|
			repeatedly and the cache is available until the
			unite buffer is closed.  To cache longer, the source
			has no choise but to cache by itself.

					*unite-source-attribute-is_listed*
is_listed		Number		(Optional)
			Whether the source name is visible to the user.
			If the source is internal, it must be set to 0.  If
			it's omitted, it's set to 1.

					*unite-source-attribute-description*
description		String		(Optional)
			The description of the source.
			If it's ommitted, it's set to "".
			|unite-source-source| uses this.

					*unite-source-attribute-syntax*
syntax			String		(Optional)
			The syntax name used within the source.  This
			syntax name is defined automatically by unite
			itself.
			If it's omitted, it's set to "".
			This is used to configure the source's own
			highlight.  According to the unite's naming
			convension to avoid the syntax name conflicted,
			use syntax name like "uniteSource__(source
			name)".  Configuration of highlight itself must
			use |unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_syntax|.

					*unite-source-attribute-filters*
filters			List		(Optional)
			The list of filters used by the source.  The elements
			are filter name or function reference (accepted
			dictionary function in current source).  Please refer

			"source__" prefix must be added.

NOTATION					*unite-notation*

{context}					*unite-notation-{context}*
			A dictionary to give context information.
			The followings are the primary information.

==============================================================================
CREATE KIND					*unite-create-kind*

The files in autoload/unite/kinds are automatically loaded and it calls
unite#kinds#{kind_name}#define() whose return value is the kind.  Each return
value can be a list so you can return an empty list to avoid adding
undesireble kinds.  To add your own kinds dynamically, you can use
|unite#define_kind()|.

Note: To optimize load kind files, if "foo" kind name is detected, unite.vim
loads "autoload/unite/kinds/foo*.vim" files.  The kind file name must be kind
name prefix(Ex: foo).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KIND ATTRIBUTES					*unite-kind-attributes*

						*unite-kind-attribute-name*
name			String		(Required)
			The name of a kind.  It must consist of the
			following characters:
			- a-z
			- 0-9
			- _
			- /

			For example:
			- "buffer" , "file_mru" and "virw/git" are valid.
			- "BadOne", "!@#$%^&*()_[]{}-|" and "" are invalid.

					*unite-kind-attribute-default_action*
default_action		String		(Required)
			Specifies default action name when executing
			|<Plug>(unite_do_default_action)|.  If this attribute is
			ommitted, an error occurred.  But this hack is used in
			parent only actions.

					*unite-kind-attribute-action_table*
action_table		Dictionary		(Required)
			Adds an action table unique to the kind.  In
			this dictionary, the key is the action name and the
			value is one of dictionary attributes below.
			If the value is "nop", the actions are disabled.
			Note: "default" and "nop" names are keyword. You cannot
			use them.
			
			func			(Function)
				This function is called when executing actions.
				This function takes {candidate}.
				If "is_selectable" attribute is "1",
				{candidate} are candidate list({candidates}).
				Note: This {candidate} is cached by unite, so
				you cannot modify it.  If you modify it, you
				must use |deepcopy()|.

			description		(String)	(Optional)
				The kind description string.

			is_quit			(Number)	(Optional)
				If this attribute is "1", unite buffer is closed
				before executing actions. If this attribute is
				ommitted, "1" is used.

			is_selectable		(Number)	(Optional)
				If this attribute is "1", the action can
				execute multiple candidates.  If this attribute
				is ommitted, "0" is used.

			is_invalidate_cache	(Number)	(Optional)
				If this attribute is "1", unite invalidates
				source cache when executing the action.  If
				this attribute is ommitted, "0" is used.

			is_listed		(Number)	(Optional)
				If this attribute is "1", the action is listed
				in |<Plug>(unite_choose_action)|.  If this
				attribute is omitted, "1" is used.

					*unite-kind-attribute-alias_table*
alias_table		Dictionary		(Optional)
			Adds an alias table unique to the kind.  In
			this dictionary, the key is the action name and the
			value is the overwrite action name.
			If the value is "nop", the action is disabled.

						*unite-kind-attribute-parents*
parents			List		(Optional)
			Specifies parent list.  If this attribute is ommitted,
			["common"] is used.
			Unite searches actions from list tail(head actions are
			overwritten).
			Note: Unite searches actions from parent list
			recursively.  You must check infinity loop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPLICIT KIND				*unite-implicit-kind-for-a-source*

Unite can define actions in implicit kind.  The implicit kind name is
"source/{name}/{kind}". The {name} is source name.  If the {kind} is "*", it
matches any kinds.

For example, if you want to add "delete" action in source "file", execute
below command.
>
	call unite#custom_action('source/file/*', 'delete', function('...'))
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTION RESOLUTION ORDER				*unite-action-resolution-order*

For example, if you fire actions from kind "file" candidate gathered
by source "file", unite searches actions by order below.
Note: kind "file" extends "openable" and "cdable" kind.

(1) Custom action table for kind "source/file/file".
(2) Default action table for kind "source/file/file".
(3) Custom action table for kind "source/file/*".
(4) Default action table for kind "source/file/*".
(5) Custom action table for kind "file".
(6) Default action table for kind "file".
(7) Custom action table for kind "cdable".
(8) Default action table for kind "cdable".
(9) Custom action table for kind "openable".
(10) Default action table for kind "openable".
(11) Custom action table for kind "common".
(12) Default action table for kind "common".

==============================================================================
CREATE FILTER					*unite-create-filter*

The files in autoload/unite/filters are automatically loaded and it calls
unite#filters#{filter_name}#define() whose return value is the filter.  Each
return value can be a list so you can return an empty list to avoid adding
undesireble filter.  To add your own filters dynamically, you can use
|unite#define_filter()|.

Note: To optimize load filter files, if "matcher_foo_bar" filter name is
detected, unite.vim loads "autoload/unite/filters/matcher_foo*.vim" files.  The
filter file name must be filter name prefix(Ex: matcher_foo).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILTER ATTRIBUTES				*unite-filter-attributes*

						*unite-filter-attribute-name*
name			String		(Required)
			The filter name.

						*unite-filter-attribute-filter*
filter			Function		(Required)
			This function is called after gathering
			candidates by unite.
			This function takes {candidates} and
			{context} as its parameter and returns a
			list of {candidate}.
			The specification of the parameters and the
			returned value is same as
			|unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates|.

					*unite-filter-attribute-description*
description		String		(Optional)
			The filter description string.
