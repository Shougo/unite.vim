==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*unite-introduction*

*unite* or *unite.vim* searches and displays information from arbitrary sources like files,
buffers, recently used files or registers. You can run one of defined action
on a target displayed.

The differences between |unite| and similar plugins like |fuzzyfinder| or |ku|
are that |unite| doesn't use the built-in completion interface of Vim, and
integrates sources at the same time.

==============================================================================
USAGE						*unite-usage*

	In case when you run with files and buffers as the source
>
	:Unite file buffer
<

	In case when you run with the initial input value foo
>
	:Unite -input=foo file
<

The unite you started splits the window horizontally as default, opening on
the top of the Vim.  For example,
>
	:Unite file
<
lists up the files of the current directory.  You may choose one of the
candidates by moving j or k, and typing Enter opens the candidate in a new
buffer.  That's the default action for candidates of which kind is file.  You
may also select an action with <Tab> on a candidate.  See also |unite-action|
about the actions.

You can narrow down the candidates with a keyword.  After opening a unite
window, the cursor goes on the right side of > in the 2nd line by typing i.
Then you can input a keyword to narrow down the candidates.  Each single
characters you type narrows down the candidates.  You also can use a wild
card * as an arbitrary character sequence.  For example
>
	*hisa
<
matches hisa, ujihisa, or ujihisahisa.  Furthermore, two consequence wild cards
matches directory recursively.  For example
>
	**/foo
<
matches bar/foo or buzz/bar/foo.  Note that you should consider using
|file_rec| that will be described bellow in most cases.

You may specify multiple keywords to narrow down, separating by spaces.
>
	foo bar
<
That matches candidates that match both foo and bar.

You may specify negative conditions with !.
>
	foo !bar
<
That matches foo but candidates that match bar will be rejected.

	You may add wild cards automatically with / if you specify files on
	-buffer-name option.  That's handy in case you select file with unite.
>
	:Unite -buffer-name=files file
<
See also |unite_default_key_mappings| for other actions.

Screencast is available. Thanks ujihisa!

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*unite-install*

Install the distributed files into Vim script directory which is usually
~/.vim/, or $HOME/vimfiles on Windows.

In future VimJolts the Vim plugin package manager will support unite, you can
install unite just by `jolt install unite`.

You may run unite with |:Unite| command with source as parameters if you
succeeded in installing unite.  However, it's pain in ass to run the command
explicitly every time, so I recommend you to set a key mapping for the
command.

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*unite-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*unite-commands*

:Unite [{options}] {sources}			*:Unite*
		Shows the candidate window of {sources} with empty initial
		narrowing text.  You may specify multiple {sources} with
		spaces as a separator; the order of the {sources} will be the
		order of candidates.  See |unite-source| also for sources.

		In case you are already on unite buffer, the narrowing text
		will be stored.

		You may give a list of strings, separating with :, after the
		name of sources. You must escape : and \ with \ for parameters
		themselves.  It depends on the sources how the parameters will
		be interpreted.

		Examples:
		"file:foo:bar": the parameters of source file are [foo, bar].
		"file:foo\:bar": the parameters of source file are [foo:bar].

						*unite-options*
		{options} are options for a unite buffer.  You may give the
		following parameters for a option; you must escape with \ when
		it contains spaces.

						*unite-options-buffer-name*
		-buffer-name={buffer-name}
		Specifies a buffer name. You can share a configuration of
		functions like |unite#set_substitute_pattern()| by giving a
		buffer name for unite buffers that have same purpose.
		The default buffer name is 'default'.

						*unite-options-input*
		-input={input-text}
		Specifies an initial narrowing text. The default value is ''.

						*unite-options-prompt*
		-prompt={prompt-text}
		Specifies a prompt. The default value is '>'.

						*unite-options-default-action*
		-default-action={default-action}
		Specifies a default action. The default value is 'default'.

						*unite-options-start-insert*
						*unite-options-no-start-insert*
		-start-insert
		Opens unite buffer with narrowing mode.

		-no-start-insert
		Opens unite buffer with normal mode.

		When both options are undefined, this will depend on
		|g:unite_enable_start_insert| option.
		The behavior when both options are defined is undefined.

						*unite-options-no-quit*
		-no-quit
		Doesn't close the unite buffer after firing an action.  Unless
		you specify it, a unite buffer will be closed when you
		selected an action which is "is_quit".

						*unite-options-winwidth*
		-winwidth={window-width}
		Specifies the width of a unite buffer.  Unless you specify
		it, |g:unite_winwidth| will be used.

						*unite-options-winheight*
		-winheight={window-height}
		Specifies the height of a unite buffer.  Unless you specify
		it, |g:unite_winheight| will be used.

						*unite-options-immediately*
		-immediately
		If the number of candidates is exactly one, it runs default
		action immediately. If candidate is empty, it doesn't open
		unite buffer.

						*unite-options-auto-preview*
		-auto-preview
		When you selected candidate, it runs "preview" action
		automatically.

						*unite-options-completion*
		-completion
		Uses unite completion interface. |unite-options-col| is also
		required.

						*unite-options-col*
		-col={column-number}
		Specifies the called unite buffer position.

						*unite-options-vertical*
		-vertical
		Splits unite window vertically.

						*unite-options-horizontal*
		-horizontal
		Splits unite window horizontally.
		
		When both options are undefined, this will depend on
		|g:unite_enable_split_vertically| option.
		The behavior when both options are defined is undefined.

						*unite-options-direction*
		-direction={direction}
		Defines split position rule. The default value is same to
		|g:unite_split_rule|.

						*unite-options-verbose*
		-verbose
		Print verbose warning messages.

:UniteWithCurrentDir [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithCurrentDir*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that the initial narrowing text
		is the current directory.

:UniteWithBufferDir [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithBufferDir*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that the initial narrowing text
		is the buffer's directory.

:UniteWithCursorWord [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithCursorWord*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that the initial narrowing text
		is the word on the cursor.

:UniteResume [{buffer-name}]			*:UniteResume*
		Reuses the unite buffer previously opened named {buffer-name}.
		Reuses the last unite buffer you used if you skipped
		specifying {buffer-name}.  Narrowing texts or candidates are
		same to them.

A command of source				*:unite-sources-command*

:UniteBookmarkAdd [{file}]			*:UniteBookmarkAdd*
		Adds the file into the bookmark list. Unless you specify the
		parameter, the current position of the current file will be
		stored.

			the kinds when you skipped giving {kind-name}.

			Changing the return value is not allowed.

unite#get_sources([{source-name}])		*unite#get_sources()*
			Gets the source of {source-name}. Unless they exist
			this returns an empty dictionary.  This returns a
			dictionary which keys are source names and values are
			the sources when you skipped giving {source-name}.

			Changing the return value is not allowed.

CUSTOMS						*unite-functions-customs*

unite#start({sources}, [, {context}])		*unite#start()*
		Creates a new Unite buffer.  In case when you are already on a
		Unite buffer, the narrowing text will be preserved.

		{sources} is a list which elements are formatted as
		{source-name} or [{source-name}, [{args}, ...]].  You may
		specify multiple string arguments in {args} for {source-name}.


		Refer |unite-notation-{context}| about {context}.  If you
		skipped it will use the default value.

unite#get_context()				*unite#get_context()*
		Gets the context information of the current Unite buffer.
		This is used by functions like |unite#custom_action()| to call
		|unite#start()| internally.

unite#do_action({action-name})			*unite#do_action()*
		Returns the key sequence for running {action-name} action for
		the marked candidates.  This function works only when Unite is
		already activated.  This causes a runtime error if
		{action-name} doesn't exist or the action is invalid.

		This is handy for defining a key mapping to run an action by
		yourself.

		This runs the default action when you specify "default" on
		{action-name}.

		This runs an action on the candidates of the current line or
		the top of the candidates when none of the candidates are marked.

		This is usually used as inoremap <buffer><expr> or
		nnoremap <buffer><expr>.  For example,
>
		nnoremap <silent><buffer><expr> <C-k> unite#do_action('preview')
>
unite#smart_map({narrow-map}, {select-map})	*unite#smart_map()*
		Returns the key sequence which works both modes of narrowing
		and selecting with respect to the given narrow-map and select-map.
		Use this with |unite#do_action()|.  This will be used with
		inoremap <buffer><expr> or nnoremap <buffer><expr> usually.
		Example:
>
		inoremap <buffer><expr> ' unite#smart_map("'", unite#do_action('preview'))
<
unite#set_substitute_pattern({buffer-name}, {pattern}, {subst} [, {priority}])
						*unite#set_substitute_pattern()*
		Specifies a replace pattern of narrowing text for a Unite
		buffer which name is {buffer-name}.  "" is regarded as
		"default" and is equivalent to the case when |:Unite| without
		-buffer-name= option.  You may specify multiple {buffer-name}
		with breaking with ",".  {pattern} is the replace target
		regexp and {subst} is the substitute string.  If you specify a
		same {pattern} again, the setting will just be updated.  You
		may defeat {pattern} with giving {subst} as "".  {priority}
		prioritizes how this replaces.  If you skipped giving
		{priority} it'll be 0.  Give bigger number for a {pattern}
		which must be done earlier.  Note that the initial text of
		Unite buffer will not be replaced with these values.

		You may mimic ambiguous matching with using this function.
>
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '[[:alnum:]]', '*\0', 100)
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '[[:alnum:]]', ' \0', 100)
<
		The former does ambiguous search within / while the latter
		does over the /.

		The initial value is defined as the following; on a buffer
		which buffer_name is files, it adds a wildcard in order to
		match ~ as $HOME and to match partially /.
>
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '^\~',
		\ substitute(unite#util#substitute_path_separator($HOME), ' ', '\\\\ ', 'g'), -100)
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '[^~.*]\ze/', '\0*', 100)
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '/\ze[^~.*]', '/*', 100)
<
unite#get_substitute_pattern({buffer-name})
						*unite#get_substitute_pattern()*
		Gets the substitute pattern for narrowing text of a Unite buffer
		name {buffer-name}.  This causes an error if the substitute
		pattern of {buffer-name}.  This is for debugging.

unite#set_buffer_name_option({buffer-name}, {option-name}, {value})
						*unite#set_buffer_name_option()*
		Set {buffer-name} specialized {option-name} to {value}.
		
		This options is available:
		
		substitute_patterns		(Dictionary)
		
		filters				(List)
		
		ignorecase			(Number)
		
		smartcase			(Number)

unite#custom_default_action({kind}, {default-action})
						*unite#custom_default_action()*
		Changes the default action of {kind} into {default-action}.
		You may specify multiple {kind} with separating ",".  For
		example:
>
		call unite#custom_default_action('file', 'tabopen')
<
unite#custom_action({kind}, {name}, {action})
						*unite#custom_action()*
		Adds an {action} which name is {name} for {kind}.
		You may specify multiple {kind} with separating ",".  For
		example:
>
		let my_tabopen = {
		\ 'is_selectable' : 1,
		\ }
		function! my_tabopen.func(candidates)
		  call unite#take_action('tabopen', a:candidates)
		
		  let l:dir = isdirectory(a:candidate.word) ? a:candidate.word : fnamemodify(a:candidate.word, ':p:h')
		  execute g:unite_lcd_command '`=l:dir`'
		endfunction
		call unite#custom_action('file,buffer', 'tabopen', my_tabopen)
		unlet my_tabopen
<
unite#undef_custom_action({kind}, {name})	*unite#undef_custom_action()*
		Deletes an action which name is {name} of {kind} that you
		added with using |unite#custom_action()|.  You may specify
		multiple {kind} with separating ",".  This function doesn't do
		anything if the function doesn't exist.

unite#custom_alias({kind}, {name}, {action})
						*unite#custom_alias()*
		Define action {kind} is another name of {name} in {kind}.  You
		may specify multiple {kind} with separating ",".  If {action}
		is "nop", such action is disabled.
		example:
>
		call unite#custom_alias('file', 'h', 'left')
<
unite#custom_filters({source-name}, {filters})	*unite#custom_filters()*
		Changes the filters of {source-name} into {filters}.  You
		may specify multiple sources with separating "," in
		{source-name}.  {filters} is a name of filter or a list of
		the names.

unite#take_action({action-name}, {candidate})
						*unite#take_action()*
		Runs an action {action-name} against {candidate}.  This will
		be mainly used in |unite#custom_action()|.  When the action is
		is_selectable, the {candidate} will be automatically converted
		into a list.

unite#take_parents_action({action-name}, {candidate}, {extend-candidate})
						*unite#take_parents_action()*
		Same to |unite#take_action()| but searches the parents' action
		table with combining {extend-candidate} on {candidate}.  This
		is handy for reusing parents' actions.

unite#define_source({source})			*unite#define_source()*
		Adds {source} dynamically.  See also |unite-create-source|
		about the detail of source.  If a source which name is same
		exists, that will be overwritten.

unite#define_kind({kind})			*unite#define_kind()*
		Adds {kind} dynamically.  See also |unite-create-kind|
		about the detail of kind.  If a kind which name is same
		exists, that will be overwritten.

unite#define_filter({filter})			*unite#define_filter()*
		Adds {filter} dynamically.  See also |unite-create-filter|
		about the detail of filter.  If a filter which name is same
		exists, that will be overwritten.

unite#undef_source({name})			*unite#undef_source()*
		Removes the source which name is {name} that was added by
		|unite#define_source()|.  If such a source doesn't exist, this
		function doesn't do anything.

unite#undef_kind({name})			*unite#undef_kind()*
		Removes the kind which name is {name} that was added by
		|unite#define_kind()|.  If such a kind doesn't exist, this
		function doesn't do anything.

==============================================================================
KINDS						*unite-kinds*

						*unite-kind-common*
common		A kind for common actions.  Almost all kinds inherit this
		common implicitly. This only requires word key.

						*unite-kind-openable*
openable	An interface that can open.  This doesn't require any keys,
		but a kind that inherits this requires open action.

						*unite-kind-cdable*
cdable		An interface that can cd.

			action__directory	(String)	(Required)
				The target directory

						*unite-kind-file*
file		An interface for files.  This kind is inheriting cdable and
		openable, so this requires kinds that they require.

			action__path		(String)	(Required)
				The path of the target directory

						*unite-kind-buffer*
buffer		An interface for buffers.  This kind is inheriting file, so
		this requires keys that it requires.

			action__buffer_nr	(String		(Required)
				The number of the target buffer

						*unite-kind-tab*
tab		An interface for tabs.  If you can use |gettabvar()|, since this
		kind inherits cdable, this requires keys that those kind
		require.

			action__tab_nr		(String)	(Required)
				The number of the tab

						*unite-kind-directory*
directory	An interface for directories.  This kind is inheriting file,
		this requires keys it requires.

						*unite-kind-word*
word		A String that you can insert

			word			(String)	(Required)
				The string you want to insert

						*unite-kind-jump_list*
jump_list	An interface for jump lists.  This kind is inheriting
		openable, so this requires that it requires.

			action__path		(String)	(Required)
				The path of the file that you'll jump into.

			action__line		(Number)	(Optional)
				The line number in the file you'll jump into.

			action__pattern		(String)	(Optional)
				The search pattern that you'll search after
				you open the file.

			action__signature	(String)	(Optional)
				In case you cannot assume the uniqueness where
				you'll jump into only by the pattern of
				action__pattern and action__line, a unique
				String to distinguish lines that match same
				pattern.

		About action__signature and calc_signature() function

		A source which specifies action__signature must define
		cals_signatre() function for calculating the signature by the
		line number of the buffer.  calc_signature() receives {lnum}
		as the first argument and returns a signature in String, where
		{lnum} is a line number.  jump_list compares signatures with
		calling this function.

		The below is an example.
>
		function! s:source.calc_signature(lnum)
		  let range = 2
		  let from = max([1, a:lnum - range])
		  let to   = min([a:lnum + range, line('$')])
		  return join(getline(from, to))
		endfunction
