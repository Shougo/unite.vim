==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*unite-introduction*

*unite* searches and displays information from arbitrary sources like files,
buffers, recently used files or registers. You can run one of defined action
on a target displayed.

The differences between |unite| and similar plugins like |fuzzyfinder| or |ku|
are that |unite| doesn't use the built-in completion interface of Vim, and
integrates sources at the same time.

==============================================================================
USAGE						*unite-usage*

	In case when you run with files and buffers as the source
>
	:Unite file buffer
<

	In case when you run with the initial input value foo
>
	:Unite -input=foo file
<

The unite you started splits the window horizontally as default, opening on
the top of the Vim.  For example,
>
	:Unite file
<
lists up the files of the current directory.  You may choose one of the
candidates by moving j or k, and typing Enter opens the candidate in a new
buffer.  That's the default action for candidates of which kind is file.  You
may also select an action with <Tab> on a candidate.  See also |unite-action|
about the actions.

You can narrow down the candidates with a keyword.  After opening a unite
window, the cursor goes on the right side of > in the 2nd line by typing i.
Then you can input a keyword to narrow down the candidates.  Each single
characters you type narrows down the candidates.  You also can use a wild
card * as an arbitrary character sequence.  For example
>
	*hisa
<
matches hisa, ujihisa, or ujihisahisa.  Furthermore, two consequence wild cards
matches directory recursively.  For example
>
	**/foo
<
matches bar/foo or buzz/bar/foo.  Note that you should consider using
|file_rec| that will be described bellow in most cases.

You may specify multiple keywords to narrow down, separating by spaces.
>
	foo bar
<
That matches candidates that match both foo and bar.

You may specify negative conditions with !.
>
	foo !bar
<
That matches foo but candidates that match bar will be rejected.

	You may add wild cards automatically with / if you specify files on
	-buffer-name option.  That's handy in case you select file with unite.
>
	:Unite -buffer-name=files file
<
See also |unite_default_key_mappings| for other actions.

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*unite-install*

Install the distributed files into Vim script directory which is usually
~/.vim/, or $HOME/vimfiles on Windows.

In future VimJolts the Vim plugin package manager will support unite, you can
install unite just by `jolt install unite`.

You may run unite with |:Unite| command with source as parameters if you
succeeded in installing unite.  However, it's pain in ass to run the command
explicitly every time, so I recommend you to set a key mapping for the
command.

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*unite-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*unite-commands*

:Unite [{options}] {sources}			*:Unite*
		Shows the candidate window of {sources} with empty initial
		narrowing text.  You may specify multiple {sources} with
		spaces as a separator; the order of the {sources} will be the
		order of candidates.  See |unite-source| also for sources.

		In case you are already on unite buffer, the narrowing text
		will be stored.

		You may give a list of strings, separating with :, after the
		name of sources. You must escape : and \ with \ for parameters
		themselves.  It depends on the sources how the parameters will
		be interpreted.

		Examples:
		"file:foo:bar": the parameters of source file are [foo, bar].
		"file:foo\:bar": the parameters of source file are [foo:bar].

		{options} are options for a unite buffer.  You may give the
		following parameters for a option; you must escape with \ when
		it contains spaces.

		-buffer-name={buffer-name}
		Specifies a buffer name. You can share a configuration of
		functions like |unite#set_substitute_pattern()| by giving a
		buffer name for unite buffers that have same purpose.
		The default buffer name is 'default'.

		-input={input-text}
		Specifies an initial narrowing text. The default value is ''.

		-prompt={prompt-text}
		Specifies a prompt. The default value is '> '.

		-default-action={default-action}
		Specifies a default action. The default value is 'default'.

		-start-insert
		Opens unite with narrowing mode. Otherwise the initial mode
		will be Normal mode.

		-no-quit
		Doesn't close the unite buffer after firing an action.  Unless
		you specify it, a unite buffer will be closed when you
		selected an action which is "is_quit".

		-winwidth={window-width}
		Specifies the width of a unite buffer.  Unless you specify
		it, |g:unite_winwidth| will be used.

		-winheight={window-height}
		Specifies the height of a unite buffer.  Unless you specify
		it, |g:unite_winheight| will be used.

:UniteWithCurrentDir [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithCurrentDir*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that the initial narrowing text
		is the current directory.

:UniteWithBufferDir [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithBufferDir*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that the initial narrowing text
		is the buffer's directory.

:UniteWithCursorWord [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithCursorWord*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that the initial narrowing text
		is the word on the cursor.

:UniteResume [{buffer-name}]name		*:UniteResume*
		Reuses the unite buffer previously opened named {buffer-name}.
		Reuses the last unite buffer you used if you skipped
		specifying {buffer-name}.  Narrowing texts or candidates are
		same to them.

A command of source				*:unite-sources-command*

:UniteBookmarkAdd [{file}]			*:UniteBookmarkAdd*
		Adds the file into the bookmark list. Unless you specify the
		parameter, the current position of the current file will be
		stored.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLES 					*unite-variables*

g:unite_update_time				*g:unite_update_time*
		Update time interval of candidates for each input of narrowing
		text.  In Msec.

		Default value is 200.

g:unite_enable_start_insert			*g:unite_enable_start_insert*
		If this variable is 1, unite buffer will be Insert Mode
		immediately.

		Default value is 0.

g:unite_enable_ignore_case			*g:unite_enable_ignore_case*
		Ignores case when the value is 1.

		Default value is same to 'ignorecase' option.

g:unite_enable_smart_case			*g:unite_enable_smart_case*
		Distinguish capitals from smalls when the narrowing text has a
		capital letter if this variable is 1.
		
		Default value is same to 'infercase'.

g:unite_split_rule				*g:unite_split_rule*
		Defines split position rule.

		Default value is "topleft".

g:unite_enable_split_vertically				*g:unite_enable_split_vertically*
		If this option is 1, splits unite window vertically.

		Default value is 0; unite window will be splat horizontally.

g:unite_winheight					*g:unite_winheight*
		The height of unite window when it's split horizontally.  It's
		ignored in splitting vertically.

		The default value is 20.

g:unite_winwidth					*g:unite_winwidth*
		The width of unite window when it's split vertically.  It's
		ignored in splitting horizontally.

		The default value is 90.

g:unite_cd_command					*g:unite_cd_command*

		unite itself or its sources.  If the directory doesn't exist
		the directory will be automatically generated.  For example source

		files on the directory.
		
		Default value is expand('~/.unite'); the absolute path of it.

g:unite_no_default_keymappings			*g:unite_no_default_keymappings*
		If it's 1, unite doesn't map any defauilt key mappings.  You

SOURCES VARIABLES 					*unite-sources-variables*

g:unite_source_file_ignore_pattern		*g:unite_source_file_ignore_pattern*
		Specifies a regex pattern for ignoring some specific
		candidates in which source is file.  This matches on the full
		path of each files.  If the variable isn't empty string, unite
		filters with the regex pattern on the results.  It depends on
		'ignorecase' to distinguish cases or not.

		Refer autoload/unite/sources/file.vim about the default value.
