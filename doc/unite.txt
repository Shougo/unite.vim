INTRODUCTION					*unite-introduction*

The *unite* or *unite.vim* plug-in can search and display information from
arbitrary sources like files, buffers, recently used files or registers.  You
can run several pre-defined actions on a target displayed in the unite window.

The difference between |unite| and similar plug-ins like |fuzzyfinder|,
|ctrl-p| or |ku| is, |unite| provides an integration interface for several
sources and you can create new interface using |unite|.

==============================================================================
USAGE						*unite-usage*

	In case you run unite to display files and buffers as sources to pick
	from.
>
	:Unite file buffer
<

	In case you run unite with an initial filter value (foo) to narrow
	down files.
>
	:Unite -input=foo file
<

If you start unite it splits the window horizontally and pops up
from the top of Vim by default.
>
	:Unite file
<
The example call above lists all the files in the current directory. You can
choose one of them in the in the unite window by moving the cursor up and down
as usual with j and k. If you type Enter on an active candidate it will open
it in a new buffer. Enter triggers the default action for a candidate which is
"open" for candidates of the kind "file". You can also select an alternative
action for a candidate with <Tab>. See also |unite-action| to read on about
actions.

You can also narrow down the list of candidates by a keyword. If you change
into the insert mode inside of a unite window, the cursor drops you behind the
">" in the second line from above. There you can start typing to filter the
candidates.  You can also use the wild card "*" as an arbitrary character
sequence. For
example
>
	*hisa
<
matches hisa, ujihisa, or ujihisahisa. Furthermore, two consecutive wild cards
match a directory recursively.
>
	**/foo
<
So the example above matches bar/foo or buzz/bar/foo.
Note: The unite action |file_rec| does a recursive file matching by default
without the need to set wildcards.

You can also specify multiple keywords to narrow down the candidates. Multiple
keywords need to be separated either by a space " " or a dash "|". The
examples below match for candidates that meet both conditions "foo" and "bar".
>
	foo bar
	foo|bar
<
You can also specify negative conditions with an exclamation mark "!".  This
matches candidates that meet "foo" but do not meet "bar".
>
	foo !bar
<
Wild cards are added automatically if you add a "/" in the filter and you have
specified "files" as the buffer name with the option "-buffer-name". That's
handy in case you select files with unite.
>
	:Unite -buffer-name=files file
<
See also |unite_default_key_mappings| for other actions.

There is also a screencast available which shows unite in action. Thanks to

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*unite-install*

Install the distributed files into your Vim script directory which is usually
~/.vim/, or $HOME/vimfiles on Windows. You should consider to use one of the
famous package managers for Vim like vundle or neobundle to install the
plugin.

After installation you can run unite with the |:Unite| command and append the
sources to the command you wish to select from as parameters. However, it's a
pain in the ass to run the command explicitly every time, so I recommend you
to set a key mapping for the command.

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*unite-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS 					*unite-commands*

:Unite [{options}] {sources}			*:Unite*
		Shows the candidate window of {sources} with the initial
		narrowing text empty.  You may specify multiple {sources} with
		spaces as a separator; the order of the {sources} is equal to
		the order of candidates.  See also |unite-source| for sources.
		This command restores previous position.

		In case you are already on a unite buffer, the narrowing text
		is stored.

		You may give a list of strings, separated with ":", after
		the name of sources. You must escape ":" and "\" with "\"
		in parameters themselves. "::" is an abbreviation argument. It
		depends on the sources how the parameters are interpreted.

		Examples:
		"file:foo:bar": the parameters of source file are
		                ["foo", "bar"].
		"file:foo\:bar": the parameter of source file is
		                ["foo:bar"].
		"file:foo::baz": the parameters of source file are
		                ["foo", "", "bar"].

		{options} are options for a unite buffer: |unite-options|

:UniteWithCurrentDir [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithCurrentDir*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that it targets the current
		directory for the initial narrowing text.

:UniteWithBufferDir [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithBufferDir*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that it targets the buffer's
		directory for the initial narrowing text.

:UniteWithInput [{options}] {sources}		*:UniteWithInput*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that it targets the user input
		for the initial narrowing text.

:UniteWithCursorWord [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithCursorWord*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that it targets the word on the
		cursor for the initial narrowing text.

:UniteResume [{options}] [{buffer-name}]	*:UniteResume*
		Reuses the unite buffer named {buffer-name} that you opened
		previously. Narrowing texts or candidates are
		as-is. If {options} are given, context information gets
		overridden.
		Note: Reuses the last unite buffer you used in current tab if
		you skip specifying {buffer-name}.

:UniteClose {buffer-name}			*:UniteClose*
		Closes the unite buffer named {buffer-name}.

The commands of source				*:unite-sources-commands*

:UniteBookmarkAdd [{file}]			*:UniteBookmarkAdd*
		Adds a file into the bookmark list. Unless you specify any
		parameter, the current position of the current file is
		stored.

FUNCTIONS					*unite-functions*

CORE						*unite-functions-core*

unite#get_kinds([{kind-name}])			*unite#get_kinds()*
		Gets the kinds of {kind-name}.  Unless they exist, this
		returns an empty dictionary.  This returns a dictionary of
		that keys are kind names and values are the kinds when you
		skip giving {kind-name}.

		Note: Changing the return value is not allowed.

unite#get_sources([{source-name}])		*unite#get_sources()*
		Gets the loaded source of {source-name}. Unless they exist,
		this returns an empty dictionary.  This returns a dictionary
		of that keys are source names and values are the sources when
		you skip giving {source-name}.  If you give {source-name} as
		dictionary, unite.vim use this source temporary.

		Note: Changing the return value is not allowed.

unite#get_unite_winnr({buffer-name})		*unite#get_unite_winnr()*
		Returns unite window number which has {buffer-name}. If the
		window is not found, it will return -1.

unite#redraw([{winnr}])				*unite#redraw()*
		Redraw {winnr} unite window. If you omit {winnr}, current
		window number will be used.

unite#force_redraw([{winnr}])			*unite#force_redraw()*
		Force redraw {winnr} unite window. If you omit {winnr},
		current window number will be used.

CUSTOMS						*unite-functions-customs*

unite#start({sources}, [, {context}])		*unite#start()*
		Creates a new Unite buffer.  In case when you are already on a
		Unite buffer, the narrowing text is preserved.

		{sources} is a list of which elements are formatted as
		{source-name} or [{source-name}, {args}, ...].  You may
		specify multiple string arguments for {args} of {source-name}.

		Refer |unite-notation-{context}| about {context}.  If you
		skip a value, it uses the default value.

unite#start_complete({sources}, [{context}])	*unite#start_complete()*
		Returns the key sequence that opens unite buffer for
		completion.  This will be used with inoremap <buffer><expr>
		usually.
		Example:
>
		inoremap <buffer><expr> <C-l> unite#start_complete(
		\ ['vimshell/history'], {
		\ 'start_insert' : 0,
		\ 'input' : vimshell#get_cur_text()})
<
unite#get_candidates({sources}, [, {context}])	*unite#get_candidates()*
		Get a list of all candidates of sources. Unite buffer is not
		created.  This function may not work in some sources. The
		arguments feature is same to |unite#start()|.
		Note: max_candidates option of sources is ignored.

unite#do_candidates_action({action-name}, {candidates}, [, {context}])
						*unite#do_candidates_action()*
		Does {action-name} with {candidates}. Unite buffer is not
		created.  This function may not work in some actions.
		Note: To get candidates, use |unite#get_candidates()|.

unite#get_context()				*unite#get_context()*
		Gets the context information of the current Unite buffer.
		This is used by functions like |unite#custom_action()| to call
		|unite#start()| internally.

unite#do_action({action-name})			*unite#do_action()*
		Returns the key sequence for running {action-name} action to
		the marked candidates.  This function works only when Unite
		has been already activated.  This causes a runtime error if
		{action-name} doesn't exist or the action is invalid.

		This is handy for defining a key mapping to run an action.

		This runs the default action when you specify "default" for
		{action-name}.

		This runs an action on the candidates of the current line or
		the top of the candidates when none of the candidates are
		marked.

		This is usually used as inoremap <buffer><expr> or
		nnoremap <buffer><expr>.  For example,
>
		nnoremap <silent><buffer><expr> <C-k> unite#do_action('preview')
>
unite#smart_map({narrow-map}, {select-map})	*unite#smart_map()*
		Returns the key sequence which works both modes of narrowing
		and selecting with respect to the given narrow-map and
		select-map.  Use this with |unite#do_action()|.  This will be
		used with inoremap <buffer><expr> or nnoremap <buffer><expr>
		usually.
		Example:
>
		inoremap <buffer><expr> ' unite#smart_map("'", unite#do_action('preview'))
<
unite#get_status_string()			 *unite#get_status_string()*
		Returns unite status string. It is useful to custom
		statusline.

unite#mappings#set_current_filters({filters})
					*unite#mappings#set_current_filters()*
		Changes current unite buffer filters.
		Example:
>
  nnoremap <buffer><expr> S      unite#mappings#set_current_filters(
        \ empty(unite#mappings#get_current_filters()) ? ['sorter_reverse'] : [])
<
unite#mappings#get_current_filters()
					*unite#mappings#get_current_filters()*
		Gets current unite buffer filters.

unite#set_substitute_pattern({profile-name}, {pattern}, {subst} [, {priority}])
						*unite#set_substitute_pattern()*
		Specify a replace pattern of narrowing text for a Unite buffer
		of which name is {profile-name}.  "" is regarded as "default"
		and is equivalent to the case of |:Unite| without
		-buffer-name= option.  You may specify multiple {profile-name}
		with breaking with ",".  {pattern} is the replace target
		regexp and {subst} is the substitute string.  If you specify a
		same {pattern} again, the setting is just updated.  You may
		defeat {pattern} with giving "" to {subst}.  {priority}
		prioritizes how this replaces.  If you skipped giving
		{priority} it is 0.  Give bigger number for a {pattern} which
		must be done earlier.
		Note: that the initial text of Unite buffer is not replaced
		with these values.

		You may mimic ambiguous matching with using this function.
>
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '[^*]\ze[[:alnum:]]', '\0*', 100)
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '[[:alnum:]]', ' \0', 100)
<
		The former does ambiguous search within "/" while the latter
		does over it.

		The initial value is defined as the following; on a buffer of
		which profile_name is files, it adds a wildcard in order to
		match ~ as $HOME and to match "/" partially.
>
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '^\~',
		\ substitute(unite#util#substitute_path_separator($HOME), ' ', '\\\\ ', 'g'), -100)
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '[^~.*]\ze/', '\0*', 100)
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '/\ze[^~.*]', '/*', 100)
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '\.', '*.', 1000)
<
		If {subst} is a list, Unite searches by some narrowing texts.
		Note: It is only once to be replaced with a list.
>
		call unite#set_substitute_pattern('files', '^\.v/',
		\ [expand('~/.vim/'), unite#util#substitute_path_separator($HOME) . '/.bundle/*/'], 1000)
<
unite#get_substitute_pattern({profile-name})
						*unite#get_substitute_pattern()*
		Gets the substitute pattern for narrowing text of a Unite
		buffer name {profile-name}.  This causes an error without the
		substitute pattern of {profile-name}.  This is for debugging.

unite#set_profile({profile-name}, {option-name}, {value})
						*unite#set_profile()*
		Set {profile-name} specialized {option-name} to {value}.
		Note: If you use single source in unite.vim commands with
		omitting profile name and buffer name, "source/{source-name}"
		is used. So you can define source specific profile.

		These options below are available:

		substitute_patterns		(Dictionary)
		Specify substitute patterns. The key is "pattern",
		"subst" and "priority". Please refer to
		|unite#set_substitute_pattern()|.

		filters				(List)
		Specify a list of filter names. The filters are called after
		combining all candidates. If you change filters dynamically,
		use |unite#mappings#set_current_filters()| instead.

		ignorecase			(Number)
		Specify 'ignorecase' value in unite buffer. If it is
		omitted, global 'ignorecase' value is used.
		Note: If profile_name is "files", the default value "1" is
		used.

		smartcase			(Number)
		Specify 'smartcase' value in unite buffer. If it is omitted,
		global 'smartcase' value is used.
		Note: If profile_name is "files", the default value "0" is
		used.

		context				(Dictionary)
		Specify default {context} value in unite buffer.
		You can custom the context in unite buffer.
		Note: In temporary unite buffer and script created unite
		buffer, the context overwrites current context instead of
		default context.

		Example:
>
		" Start insert mode in unite-action buffer.
		call unite#set_profile('action', 'context',
		\ {'start_insert' : 1})
		" Set "-no-quit" automatically in grep unite source.
		call unite#set_profile('source/grep', 'context',
		\ {'no_quit' : 1})
<
unite#set_buffer_name_option({buffer-name}, {option-name}, {value})
					*unite#set_buffer_name_option()*
		This function is deprecated. Please use
		|unite#set_profile()| instead.

unite#custom_default_action({kind}, {default-action})
					*unite#custom_default_action()*
		Changes the default action of {kind} into {default-action}.
		You may specify multiple {kind} with separating ",".  For
		Example:
>
		call unite#custom_default_action('file', 'tabopen')
<
unite#custom_action({kind}, {name}, {action})
						*unite#custom_action()*
		Adds an {action} of which name is {name} for {kind}.
		You may specify multiple {kind} with separating ",".
		For example:
>
		let my_tabopen = {
		\ 'is_selectable' : 1,
		\ }
		function! my_tabopen.func(candidates)
		  call unite#take_action('tabopen', a:candidates)
		
		  let dir = isdirectory(a:candidate.word) ?
		  \    a:candidate.word : fnamemodify(a:candidate.word, ':p:h')
		  execute g:unite_kind_openable_lcd_command '`=dir`'
		endfunction
		call unite#custom_action('file,buffer', 'tabopen', my_tabopen)
		unlet my_tabopen
<
unite#undef_custom_action({kind}, {name})	*unite#undef_custom_action()*
		Deletes an action of which name is {name} of {kind} that you
		added with using |unite#custom_action()|.  You may specify
		multiple {kind} with separating ",".  This function doesn't do
		anything if the function doesn't exist.

unite#custom_alias({kind}, {name}, {action})
						*unite#custom_alias()*
		Defines an action of {name} which is another name of {action}
		in {kind}.  You may specify multiple {kind} with separating
		",".  If {action} is "nop", such action is disabled.
		example:
>
		call unite#custom_alias('file', 'h', 'left')
<
unite#custom_filters({source-name}, {filters})	*unite#custom_filters()*
		Changes the filters of {source-name} into {filters}. You may
		specify multiple sources with separating "," in {source-name}.
		{filters} is a name of filter or a list of the names.
		Note: This function is deprecated. Please use
		|unite#custom_source()| instead.

unite#custom_max_candidates({source-name}, {max})
					*unite#custom_max_candidates()*
		Changes the max candidates of {source-name} into {max}.  You
		may specify multiple sources with separating "," in
		{source-name}.
		Note: This function is deprecated. Please use
		|unite#custom_source()| instead.

unite#custom_source({source-name}, {option-name}, {value})
						*unite#custom_source()*
		Set {source-name} source specialized {option-name} to {value}.
		You may specify multiple sources with separating "," in
		{source-name}.

		These options below are available:

		filters				(List)
		Specify a list of filter names.  The filters overwrite source
		default filters.

		matchers			(List) or (String)
		Specify a list of matcher names.  The filters overwrite source
		default matchers.

		About action__signature and calc_signature() function

		A source which specifies action__signature must define
		cals_signatre() function for calculating the signature by the
		line number of the buffer.  calc_signature() receives {lnum}
		as the first argument and returns a signature in String, where
		{lnum} is a line number.  jump_list compares signatures with
		calling this function.

		The below is an example.
>
		function! s:source.calc_signature(lnum)
		  let range = 2

CREATE SOURCE					*unite-create-source*

The files in autoload/unite/sources are automatically loaded and it
calls unite#sources#{source_name}#define() whose return value is the source.
Each return value can be a list so you can return an empty list to avoid
adding undesirable sources.  To add your own sources dynamically, you can use
|unite#define_source()|.

Note: To optimize load source files, if "buffer/rec" source name is detected,
unite.vim loads "autoload/unite/sources/buffer*.vim" or
"autoload/unite/sources/rec*.vim" files.  The source file name must have
source name prefix(Ex: buffer) or source name postfix(Ex: rec).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOURCE ATTRIBUTES				*unite-source-attributes*

						*unite-source-attribute-name*
name			String		(Required)
			The name of a source.  It must consist of the
			following characters:
			- a-z
			- 0-9
			- _
			- /
			- - (Not head)

			For example:
			- "buffer" , "file_mru" and "view/git" are
			  valid.
			- "BadOne", "!@#$%^&*()_[]{}-|" and "" are
			  invalid.

				*unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates*
gather_candidates	Function	(Required)
			This function is called once in gathering candidates
			and anytime in redrawing by |<Plug>(unite_redraw)|.
			If source is defined as |unite-source-is_volatile|,
			this function is called whenever the input string is
			changed.  This function takes {args} and {context} as
			its parameter and returns a list of {candidate}.
			Here, {args} is a list of parameters given to the
			source when |:Unite| command is executed and {context}
			is the context information when the source is called.
			If either of these are not given, the argument becomes
			"".  Hence, this function must handle empty string.
			Arguments should be checked by |get()| function.
			For more details, you can refer to
			|unite-notation-{context}| about {context} and
			|unite-notation-{candidate}| about {candidate}.
			This attribute can be omitted if other attributes can
			gather some candidates.
			The candidates gathered by this attribute are cached
			by unite buffer.  The cache is available until the
			unite buffer is closed and is discarded unless you use
			|:UniteResume|.  To cache persistently regardless of
			the life of the unite buffer, you have some source to
			save the cache on non-volatile storage.

				*unite-source-attribute-change_candidates*
change_candidates	Function	(Optional)
			This function is called if the input string is changed
			in gathering candidates by unite.  You can make use of
			this attribute to generate candidates from the input
			string.  The candidates generated by this attributes
			are added to the candidates cached by
			|unites-source-attribute-gather_candidates|.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameter and returns a list of {candidate}.
			The specification of the parameters and the returned
			value is same as
			|unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates|.

			*unite-source-attribute-async_gather_candidates*
async_gather_candidates	Function	(Optional)
			This function is called asynchronously in gathering
			candidates.  You can make use of this function to
			split time-consuming job into small jobs.
			|g:unite_update_time| is the default timing.  This
			function takes {args} and {context} as its parameter
			and returns a list of {candidate}.

			The specification of the parameters and the returned
			value is same as
			|unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates|.

					*unite-source-attribute-complete*
complete		Function	(Optional)
			This functions is called to complete the source
			argument of |:Unite|.  This function takes {args},
			{context}, {arglead}, {cmdline} and {cursorpos} as its
			parameter and returns a list of candidates.

						*unite-source-attribute-hooks*
hooks			Dictionary		(Optional)
			You may put hook functions in this dictionary in which
			the key is the position to hook and the value is the
			reference to the function to be called.  The following
			hook functions are defined:

			on_init		*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_init*
			Called just before returning to unite buffer after
			executing |:Unite| commands or calling |unite#start()|
			but executing |:UniteResume|.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameters.
			Note that you must be careful to select the function
			to call because the unite buffer is not still
			initialized in calling this hook function.

			on_syntax
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_syntax*
			Called after the unite buffer is initialized and
			syntax for each source is set but not called if
			|unite-source-attribute-syntax| is not set.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameters.
			Highlight configuration for each source is done by
			this function.

			Note: To get abbr head column, use
			"unite#get_current_unite().abbr_head".
			Example:
>
			syntax match uniteSource_FileMru_Time /(.*)/ contained containedin=uniteSource_FileMru
			highlight default link uniteSource_FileMru_Time Statement
<
			Note you must set the contained in of the same syntax
			name as for |unite-source-attribute-syntax|.

			on_close
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_close*
			Called after executing |<Plug>(unite_exit)| or closing
			the unite buffer following some command execution.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameters.

			on_pre_filter
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_pre_filter*
			Called before the filters to narrow down the
			candidates. This function takes {args} and {context}
			as its parameters.

			on_post_filter
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_post_filter*
			Called after the filters to narrow down the
			candidates.  This is used to set attributes.
			This filters is to avoid adversely affecting the
			performance.  This function takes {args} and {context}
			as its parameters.

			on_pre_init
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_pre_init*
			Called before source is initialized.
			{args} is empty.
			Current source is set as "a:context.source" in
			{context}.
			You can dynamically initialize source by changing
			"a:context.source" in this function.

					*unite-source-attribute-action_table*
action_table		Dictionary		(Optional)
			Adds source's own action table.
			In this dictionary, the key is the kind and the value
			is the action table.  The specification of action
			table is same as |unite-kind-attribute-action_table|.
			With this dictionary, you can define original
			|unite-kind-attribute-action_table| for each kind in
			source's own context.
			For example:
>
			'action_table' : { 'buffer' : foo_action_table }
<
			means that foo_action_table is used for kind "buffer"
			in this source's context.
			You can use "*" for the key to match any kind.
			This is useful if you expect only one kind.  If no
			key-value pair is set, this dictionary is left empty.
			You can put action table without a corresponding key
			and it means the key is "*".
			For example, the following two are the same.
>
			'action_table' : foo_action_table
			'action_table' : { '*' : foo_action_table }
<
				*unite-source-attribute-default_action*
default_action		Dictionary		(Optional)
			Adds default action unique to the source.
			In this dictionary, the key is the kind and the value
			is the default action.
			If it's not given, the kind's default action is used.
			The default action can be in string format and
			it means the same as:
>
			'default_action' : { '*' : action_name}.
<
					*unite-source-attribute-default_kind*
default_kind		String			(Optional)
			Default kind in source candidates.
			If it's not given, the "common" is used.

					*unite-source-attribute-alias_table*
alias_table		Dictionary		(Optional)
			Adds an alias table unique to the source.
			In this dictionary, the key is the kind and the value
			is the alias table.
			If the key is '*', it matches any kinds.
			Please refer to |unite-kind-attribute-action_table|
			for the specification of alias table.
			If no key-value is set, this dictionary is left
			empty.

					*unite-source-attribute-max_candidates*
max_candidates		Number		(Optional)
			The maximum number of candidates.

			This attribute is optional; if it is not given,
			0 is used as the default value.  This means
			maximum number is infinity.

			*unite-source-attribute-required_pattern_length*
required_pattern_length	Number		(Optional)
			The least string length to narrow down the candidates.
			This attribute is optional.
			If it's not given, 0 is used as the default value and
			all the possible candidates are collected.

					*unite-source-attribute-is_volatile*
is_volatile		Number		(Optional)
			Whether the source recalculates the candidates
			everytime the input is changed.
			This attribute is optional.
			If it's not given, 0 is set as the default value. In
			this case, candidates are cached in unite buffer and
			it does not call
			|unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates|
			repeatedly and the cache is available until the unite
			buffer is closed.  To cache longer, the source has no
			choice but to cache by itself.

					*unite-source-attribute-is_listed*
is_listed		Number		(Optional)
			Whether the source name is visible to the user.
			If the source is internal, it must be set to 0.  If
			it's omitted, it's set to 1.

			name is defined automatically by unite itself.
			If it's omitted, it's set to "".
			This is used to configure the source's own highlight.
			According to the unite's naming conversion to avoid
			the syntax name conflicted, use syntax name like
			"uniteSource__(source name)".  Configuration of
			highlight itself must use
			|unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_syntax|.

					*unite-source-attribute-filters*
filters			List		(Optional)
			The list of filters used by the source.  The elements
			are filter name or function reference (accepted
			dictionary function in current source).  Please refer

			Note: If name is "unite__new_candidate", it will be
			used for |<Plug>(unite_new_candidate)|. It adds a
			candidate in current source.

			func			(Function)
				This function is called when executing
				actions.  This function takes {candidate}.
				If "is_selectable" attribute is "1",
				{candidate} are candidate list({candidates}).

files by mistake.
>
	call unite#custom_alias('file', 'delete', 'vimfiler__delete')
<
Q: I want to input register values in insert mode.

A: You can use below mappings.

	\ unite#start_complete('register', { 'input': unite#get_cur_text() })
<
