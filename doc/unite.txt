INTRODUCTION					*unite-introduction*

*unite* or *unite.vim* is a common extensible interface for searching and
displaying lists of information from within vim. It can display and search
through any arbitrary source, from files and directories to buffers and
registers.

The difference between |unite| and similar plug-ins like |fuzzyfinder|,
|ctrl-p| or |ku| is, |unite| provides a standard interface for any sources.
The API is flexible enough that it can be used to build your own interface.

==============================================================================
USAGE						*unite-usage*

	To browse a list of currently open buffers like |:ls| command.
>
	:Unite buffer
<
	To browse a list of files in the current working directory.
>
	:Unite file
<
	To browse recursive list of all the files under the current working
	directory.
>
	:Unite file_rec
<
	Or you can combine sources, to browse files and buffers.
>
	:Unite file buffer
<
	There are a number of command line flags(see |unite-options|), for
	example to set an initial search term (foo) to filter files search.
>
	:Unite -input=foo file
<

Invoking unite will create a horizontal split buffer by default.
>
	:Unite file
<
This example lists all the files in the current directory.  You can select one
in the unite window by moving the cursor with normal Vim navigation,
e.g. j and k.  Pressing Enter on a candidate and it will open it in a new
buffer.

Enter will trigger the default action, which in the case of "file" is open,
however alternate actions can be defined. These alternative actions can be
invoked with <Tab>.  See also |unite-action| to read on about different
actions.

You can also narrow down the list of candidates with a keyword.  By entering
insert mode in a unite window, the cursor will jump to the unite prompt (">")
at the top of the window. Typing at the unite prompt will filter the candidate
list.

You can also use the wild card "*" as an arbitrary character sequence.
>
	*hisa
<
This example matches hisa, ujihisa, or ujihisahisa.

Two consecutive wild cards recursively match directories.
>
	**/foo
<
This example would matche bar/foo or buzz/bar/foo.

Note: The unite action |file_rec| (read: file recursive) does a recursive
file search by default without the need to set wildcards.

Multiple keywords can be be use to narrow down the candidates.  They are
separated by either a space " " or a pipe "|", and act like a logical AND.
>
	foo bar
	foo|bar
<
This example matches "foobar" and "foobazbar", but not "foobaz"

Specify negative conditions with a bang "!".
>
	foo !bar
<
This example matches candidates that contain "foo" but not "bar".

Specify command execution after the action with a ":".
>
	" Jump to line 3.
	foo :3
	" Search to "bar".
	foo :/bar
	" Executes :diffthis command.
	foo :diffthis
<
See |unite_default_key_mappings| for other actions.

==============================================================================
INSTALL						*unite-install*

Install the distributed files into your Vim script directory which is usually
~/.vim/, or $HOME/vimfiles on Windows.  You should consider to use one of the
famous package managers for Vim like vundle or neobundle to install the
plugin.

After installation you can run unite with the |:Unite| command and append the
sources to the command you wish to select from as parameters.  However, it's a
pain in the ass to run the command explicitly every time, so I recommend you
to set a key mapping for the command.

==============================================================================
EXAMPLES					*unite-examples*

With off the fexibility and power that unite gives you it is recommended that
you create some normal mode mappings for invoking unite in your .vimrc file.

A simple mapping that will configure <leader>-f to browse for a file in the
current working dorectory:
>
	nnoremap <leader>f :<C-u>Unite file<CR>
<
The same mapping, but instead start in insert mode so any typing will filter
the candidate list:
>
	nnoremap <leader>f :<C-u>Unite -start-insert file<CR>
<
The popular recursive file search, starting insert automatically and using
fuzzy file matching:
>
	call unite#filters#matcher_default#use(['matcher_fuzzy'])
	nnoremap <leader>r :<C-u>Unite -start-insert file_rec<CR>
<
Note: with large projects this may cause some performance problems. Normally
it is recommended to use |unite-source-file_rec/async| source, which requires
|vimproc|. The mapping might look something like this:
>
	nnoremap <leader>r :<C-u>Unite -start-insert file_rec/async:!<CR>
<
Most recently used files:
>
	nnoremap <leader>m :<C-u>Unite file_mru<CR>
<
Search through yank history. First, this must be enabled to track yank
history, then the mapping set.
>
	let g:unite_source_history_yank_enable = 1
	nnoremap <leader>y :<C-u>Unite history/yank<CR>
<
Since you can pass in multiple sources into unite you can easily create a
mapping that will open up a unite pane with the sources you frequently use.
To see buffers, recent files then bookmarks:
>
	nnoremap <silent> <leader>b :<C-u>Unite buffer file_mru bookmark<CR>
<
Much more spophisticated mappings can be configured to very quickly find what
you need in vim.

More advanced configuration example:
>
	" The prefix key.
	nnoremap    [unite]   <Nop>
	nmap    f [unite]

	nnoremap <silent> [unite]c  :<C-u>UniteWithCurrentDir
	        \ -buffer-name=files buffer file_mru bookmark file<CR>
	nnoremap <silent> [unite]b  :<C-u>UniteWithBufferDir
	        \ -buffer-name=files -prompt=%\  buffer file_mru bookmark file<CR>
	nnoremap <silent> [unite]r  :<C-u>Unite
	        \ -buffer-name=register register<CR>
	nnoremap <silent> [unite]o  :<C-u>Unite outline<CR>
	nnoremap <silent> [unite]f
	        \ :<C-u>Unite -buffer-name=resume resume<CR>

COMMANDS 					*unite-commands*

:Unite [{options}] {sources}			*:Unite*
		Unite can be invoked with one or more source. This can be done
		by specifying the list on the command line, separated by
		spaces. The list of candidates (the matches found in the source
		by your filter string) will be ordered in the same order that
		you specify the {sources}.

		If {sources} are empty, you can input source name and args
		manually.

		For example:

		:Unite file buffer

		Will first list the files, then list the buffers.

		See also |unite-source| the available sources.

		In case you are already in a unite buffer, the narrowing text
		is stored.

		Unite can accept a list of strings, separated with ":", after
		the name of sources.  You must escape ":" and "\" with "\"
		in parameters themselves. "::" is an abbreviation argument.  It
		depends on the sources how the parameters are interpreted.

		Examples:
		"file:foo:bar": the parameters of source file are
		                ["foo", "bar"].
		"file:foo\:bar": the parameter of source file is
		                ["foo:bar"].
		"file:foo::baz": the parameters of source file are
		                ["foo", "", "bar"].

		{options} are options for a unite buffer: |unite-options|

:UniteWithCurrentDir [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithCurrentDir*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that it targets the current
		directory for the initial narrowing text.

:UniteWithBufferDir [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithBufferDir*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that it targets the buffer's
		directory for the initial narrowing text.

:UniteWithInput [{options}] {sources}		*:UniteWithInput*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that it will prompt the user for
		narrowing text before opening the unite buffer.

:UniteWithCursorWord [{options}] {sources}	*:UniteWithCursorWord*
		Equivalent to |:Unite| except that it targets the word under
		the cursor for the initial narrowing text.

:UniteResume [{options}] [{buffer-name}]	*:UniteResume*
		Reuses the unite buffer named {buffer-name} that you opened
		previously.  Narrowing texts or candidates are
		as-is.  If {options} are given, context information gets
		overridden.

		Note: Reuses the last unite buffer you used in current tab if
		you skip specifying {buffer-name}.

:UniteClose {buffer-name}			*:UniteClose*
		Closes the unite buffer with {buffer-name}.

The commands of source				*:unite-sources-commands*

:UniteBookmarkAdd [{file}]			*:UniteBookmarkAdd*
		Adds a file to the bookmark list. By default this will also
		store the position of the current file.

FUNCTIONS					*unite-functions*

CORE						*unite-functions-core*

unite#get_kinds([{kind-name}])			*unite#get_kinds()*
		Gets the kinds of {kind-name}.  Unless they exist, this
		returns an empty dictionary.  This returns a dictionary of
		that keys are kind names and values are the kinds when you
		skip giving {kind-name}.

		Note: Changing the return value is not allowed.

unite#get_sources([{source-name}])		*unite#get_sources()*
		Gets the loaded source of {source-name}.  Unless they exist,
		this returns an empty dictionary.  This returns a dictionary
		of that keys are source names and values are the sources when
		you skip giving {source-name}.  If you give {source-name} as
		dictionary, unite.vim use this source temporary.

		Note: Changing the return value is not allowed.

unite#get_unite_winnr({buffer-name})		*unite#get_unite_winnr()*
		Returns unite window number which has {buffer-name}.  If the
		window is not found, it will return -1.

unite#redraw([{winnr}])				*unite#redraw()*
		Redraw {winnr} unite window.  If you omit {winnr}, current
		window number will be used.

unite#force_redraw([{winnr}])			*unite#force_redraw()*
		Force redraw {winnr} unite window.  If you omit {winnr},
		current window number will be used.

CUSTOMS						*unite-functions-customs*

unite#start({sources}, [, {context}])		*unite#start()*
		Creates a new Unite buffer.  In case when you are already on a
		Unite buffer, the narrowing text is preserved.

		{sources} is a list of which elements are formatted as
		{source-name} or [{source-name}, {args}, ...].  You may
		specify multiple string arguments for {args} of {source-name}.

		Refer |unite-notation-{context}| about {context}.  If you
		skip a value, it uses the default value.

unite#start_complete({sources}, [{context}])	*unite#start_complete()*
		Returns the key sequence that opens unite buffer for
		completion.  This will be used with inoremap <buffer><expr>
		usually.
		Example:
>
		inoremap <buffer><expr> <C-l> unite#start_complete(
		\ ['vimshell/history'], {
		\ 'start_insert' : 0,
		\ 'input' : vimshell#get_cur_text()})
<
unite#get_candidates({sources}, [, {context}])	*unite#get_candidates()*
		Get a list of all candidates of sources.  Unite buffer is not
		created.  This function may not work in some sources.  The
		arguments feature is same to |unite#start()|.
		Note: max_candidates option of sources is ignored.

						*unite#action#do_candidates()*
unite#action#do_candidates({action-name}, {candidates}, [, {context}])
		Does {action-name} with {candidates}.  Unite buffer is not
		created.  This function may not work in some actions.
		Note: To get candidates, use |unite#get_candidates()|.

unite#get_context()				*unite#get_context()*
		Gets the context information of the current Unite buffer.
		This is used by functions like |unite#custom#action()| to call
		|unite#start()| internally.

unite#do_action({action-name})			*unite#do_action()*
		Returns the key sequence for running {action-name} action to
		the marked candidates.  This function works only when Unite
		has been already activated.  This causes a runtime error if
		{action-name} doesn't exist or the action is invalid.
		Note: If you do the action, Vim's mode will be return to
		Normal mode.

		This is handy for defining a key mapping to run an action.

		This runs the default action when you specify "default" for
		{action-name}.

		This runs an action on the candidates of the current line or
		the top of the candidates when none of the candidates are
		marked.

		This is usually used as inoremap <buffer><expr> or
		nnoremap <buffer><expr>.  For example,
>
		nnoremap <silent><buffer><expr> <C-k> unite#do_action('preview')
>
unite#smart_map({narrow-map}, {select-map})	*unite#smart_map()*
		Returns the key sequence which works both modes of narrowing
		and selecting with respect to the given narrow-map and
		select-map.  Use this with |unite#do_action()|.  This will be
		used with inoremap <buffer><expr> or nnoremap <buffer><expr>
		usually.
		Example:
>
		inoremap <buffer><expr> ' unite#smart_map("'", unite#do_action('preview'))
<
unite#get_status_string()			 *unite#get_status_string()*
		Returns unite status string.  It is useful to custom
		statusline.

					*unite#mappings#set_current_filters()*
unite#mappings#set_current_filters({filters})
		Changes current unite buffer filters.
		Example:
>
  nnoremap <buffer><expr> S      unite#mappings#set_current_filters(
        \ empty(unite#mappings#get_current_filters()) ? ['sorter_reverse'] : [])
<
					*unite#mappings#get_current_filters()*
unite#mappings#get_current_filters()
		Gets current unite buffer filters.

						*unite#custom#profile()*
						*unite#set_profile()*
unite#custom#profile({profile-name}, {option-name}, {value})
		Set {profile-name} specialized {option-name} to {value}.
		Note: If you use single source in unite.vim commands with
		omitting profile name and buffer name, "source/{source-name}"
		is used.  So you can define source specific profile.

		These options below are available:

		substitute_patterns		(Dictionary)
		Specify substitute patterns.  The key is "pattern",
		"subst" and "priority".
		"pattern" is the replace target regexp and "subst" is the
		substitute string.  If you specify a same "pattern" again, the
		setting is just updated.  You may defeat "pattern" with giving
		"" to "subst".  "priority" prioritizes how this replaces.  If
		you skipped giving "priority" it is 0.  Give bigger number for
		a "pattern" which must be done earlier.
		Note: that the initial text of Unite buffer is not replaced
		with these values.

		You may mimic ambiguous matching with using this function.
>
		call unite#custom#profile('files', 'substitute_patterns', {
		      \ 'pattern' : '[^*]\ze[[:alnum:]]',
		      \ 'subst' : '\0*',
		      \ 'priority' : 100,
		      \ })
		call unite#custom#profile('files', 'substitute_patterns', {
		      \ 'pattern' : '[[:alnum:]]',
		      \ 'subst' : '\0',
		      \ 'priority' : 100,
		      \ })
<
		The former does ambiguous search within "/" while the latter
		does over it.

		The initial value is defined as the following; on a buffer of
		which profile_name is files, it adds a wildcard in order to
		match ~ as $HOME and to match "/" partially.
>
		call unite#custom#profile('files', 'substitute_patterns', {
		      \ 'pattern' : '^\~',
		      \ 'subst' : substitute(
		      \     unite#util#substitute_path_separator($HOME),
		      \           ' ', '\\\\ ', 'g'),
		      \ 'priority' : -100,
		      \ })
		call unite#custom#profile('files', 'substitute_patterns', {
		      \ 'pattern' : '\.\{2,}\ze[^/]',
		      \ 'subst' : "\\=repeat('../', len(submatch(0))-1)",
		      \ 'priority' : 10000,
		      \ })
<
		If {subst} is a list, Unite searches by some narrowing texts.
		Note: It is only once to be replaced with a list.
>
		call unite#custom#profile('files', 'substitute_patterns', {
		      \ 'pattern' : '^\.v/',
		      \ 'subst' : [expand('~/.vim/'),
		      \   unite#util#substitute_path_separator($HOME)
		      \       . '/.bundle/*/'],
		      \ 'priority' : 1000,
		      \ })
<

		filters				(List)
		Specify a list of filter names.  The filters are called after
		combining all candidates.  If you change filters dynamically,
		use |unite#mappings#set_current_filters()| instead.

		ignorecase			(Number)
		Specify 'ignorecase' value in unite buffer.  If it is
		omitted, global 'ignorecase' value is used.
		Note: If profile_name is "files", the default value "1" is
		used.

		smartcase			(Number)
		Specify 'smartcase' value in unite buffer.  If it is omitted,
		global 'smartcase' value is used.
		Note: If profile_name is "files", the default value "0" is
		used.

		context				(Dictionary)
		Specify default {context} value in unite buffer.
		You can custom the context in unite buffer.
		Note: In temporary unite buffer and script created unite
		buffer, the context overwrites current context instead of
		default context.

		Example:
>
		" Start insert mode in unite-action buffer.
		call unite#custom#profile('action', 'context',
		\ {'start_insert' : 1})
		" Set "-no-quit" automatically in grep unite source.
		call unite#custom#profile('source/grep', 'context',
		\ {'no_quit' : 1})
<
					*unite#custom#substitute()*
unite#custom#substitute({profile-name}, {pattern}, {subst} [, {priority}])

					*unite#custom_default_action()*
					*unite#custom#default_action()*
unite#custom#default_action({kind}, {default-action})
		Changes the default action of {kind} into {default-action}.
		You may specify multiple {kind} with separating ",".  For
		Example:
>
		call unite#custom#default_action('file', 'tabopen')
<
						*unite#custom#action()*
						*unite#custom_action()*
unite#custom#action({kind}, {name}, {action})
		Adds an {action} of which name is {name} for {kind}.
		You may specify multiple {kind} with separating ",".
		For example:
>
		let my_tabopen = {
		\ 'is_selectable' : 1,
		\ }
		function! my_tabopen.func(candidates)
		  call unite#take_action('tabopen', a:candidates)

		  let dir = isdirectory(a:candidate.word) ?
		  \    a:candidate.word : fnamemodify(a:candidate.word, ':p:h')
		  execute g:unite_kind_openable_lcd_command '`=dir`'
		endfunction
		call unite#custom#action('file,buffer', 'tabopen', my_tabopen)
		unlet my_tabopen
<
						*unite#custom#alias()*
						*unite#custom_alias()*
unite#custom#alias({kind}, {name}, {action})
		Defines an action of {name} which is another name of {action}
		in {kind}.  You may specify multiple {kind} with separating
		",".  If {action} is "nop", such action is disabled.
		example:
>
		call unite#custom#alias('file', 'h', 'left')
<
						*unite#custom_filters()*
unite#custom_filters({source-name}, {filters})
		Note: This function is deprecated.  Please use

						*unite-source-file*
file		Nominates an input file as a candidate.
		Note: This source doesn't nominate files in the parent
		directory (Example: "../") or hidden files(Example:
		".gitignore").  If you want to open these files, please input
		".".

		Source arguments:
		1. the file/directory path.

						*unite-source-file/new*
file/new	Nominates a new input file as a candidate.

		Source arguments:
		1. the file/directory path.

						*unite-source-file_mru*
file_mru	Nominates files you used recently as candidates, ordering
		by time series.

		For file_mru and directory_mru source, two lists are
		maintained

		1. short list for quick start; |g:unite_source_file_mru_limit|
		2. long list for tracking mru history.
		|g:unite_source_file_mru_long_limit|

		Normally, only the short list are shown in the unite window.
		To load the long list  Hit the key associated with
		|<Plug>(unite_redraw)| to trigger the unite redraw event.

		Or, you can start file_mru/directory_mru with argument
		including `*`, `_`, or `all`, `long`

		For example, `Unite file_mru:long`

		The mru code is overhauled to tracking long mru history.
		Set a large number like 5000 for the long limit will not
		impact vim performance.

						*unite-source-file_rec*
file_rec	Gather files recursive and nominates all directory or file
		names under the search directory(argument 1) or the current
		directory (if argument is omitted) as candidates.  This may get
		Vim frozen when there are too many candidates.  The candidates
		are cached by file_rec source.  To clear cache, use
		|<Plug>(unite_redraw)| keymapping.
		If argument 1 is "!", use the project directory instead of
		the current directory.  The project directory has ".git", ".svn",
		".hg".
		Note: If you edit file by Vim, file_rec source will update
		cache file.
		Note: If the candidates are over 1000, it will disable make
		cache.

		|g:unite_source_file_rec_max_cache_files|, it will disable
		make cache.

		Source arguments:
		1. the search directory.

						*unite-source-directory*
directory	Nominates an input directory as a candidate.

		Source arguments:
		1. "!" or "?".

						*unite-source-buffer_tab*
buffer_tab	Nominates opened buffers only in the current tab as
		candidates, ordering by time series.
		Argument specification is same to buffer source.

		Source arguments:
		1. "!" or "?".

						*unite-source-tab*
tab		Nominates opened tabs as candidates, regarding t:cwd as the
		current directory and t:title as the title of the tab.  This
		requires |gettabvar()|.

		If t:title exists, this is used as "word" for narrowing.
		Otherwise, the buffer name of the current tab is used.

		Source arguments:
		1. "no-current" removes current tab from candidates.

						*unite-source-register*
register	Nominates the strings stored in registers as candidates.

						*unite-source-bookmark*
bookmark	Nominates files or directories you bookmarked as candidates.

			word			(String)	(Required)
				The string you want to insert.

						*unite-kind-jump_list*
jump_list	An interface for jumping to the file position.  This kind
		inherits openable, so this requires that it requires.
		Note: The action__path or action__buffer_nr is required.

			action__path		(String)	(Required)
				The path of the file that you'll jump into.

				String to distinguish lines that match same
				pattern.

		About action__signature and calc_signature() function

		A source which specifies action__signature must define
		cals_signature() function for calculating the signature by the
		line number of the buffer.  calc_signature() receives {lnum}
		as the first argument and returns a signature in String, where
		{lnum} is a line number.  jump_list compares signatures with
		calling this function.

		The below is an example.
>
		function! s:source.calc_signature(lnum)
		  let range = 2

CREATE SOURCE					*unite-create-source*

The files in autoload/unite/sources are automatically loaded and it
calls unite#sources#{source_name}#define() whose return value is the source.
Each return value can be a list so you can return an empty list to avoid
adding undesirable sources.  To add your own sources dynamically, you can use
|unite#define_source()|.

Note: To optimize load source files, if "buffer/rec" source name is detected,
unite.vim loads "autoload/unite/sources/buffer*.vim" or
"autoload/unite/sources/rec*.vim" files.  The source file name must have
source name prefix(Ex: buffer) or source name postfix(Ex: rec).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOURCE ATTRIBUTES				*unite-source-attributes*

						*unite-source-attribute-name*
name			String		(Required)
			The name of a source.  It must consist of the
			following characters:
			- a-z
			- 0-9
			- _
			- /
			- - (Not head)

			For example:
			- "buffer" , "file_mru" and "view/git" are
			  valid.
			- "BadOne", "!@#$%^&*()_[]{}-|" and "" are
			  invalid.

				*unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates*
gather_candidates	Function	(Required)
			This function is called once in gathering candidates
			and anytime in redrawing by |<Plug>(unite_redraw)|.
			If a source is defined as |unite-source-is_volatile|,
			this function is called whenever the input string is
			changed.  This function takes {args} and {context} as
			its parameter and returns a list of {candidate}.
			Here, {args} is a list of parameters given to the
			source when |:Unite| command is executed and {context}
			is the context information when the source is called.
			If either of these are not given, the argument becomes
			"".  Hence, this function must handle empty string.
			Arguments should be checked by |get()| function.
			For more details, you can refer to
			|unite-notation-{context}| about {context} and
			|unite-notation-{candidate}| about {candidate}.
			This attribute can be omitted if other attributes can
			gather some candidates.
			The candidates gathered by this attribute are cached
			by unite buffer.  The cache is available until the
			unite buffer is closed and is discarded unless you use
			|:UniteResume|.  To cache persistently regardless of
			the life of the unite buffer, you have some source to
			save the cache on non-volatile storage.

				*unite-source-attribute-change_candidates*
change_candidates	Function	(Optional)
			This function is called if the input string is changed
			in gathering candidates by unite.  You can make use of
			this attribute to generate candidates from the input
			string.  The candidates generated by this attributes
			are added to the candidates cached by
			|unites-source-attribute-gather_candidates|.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameter and returns a list of {candidate}.
			The specification of the parameters and the returned
			value is same as
			|unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates|.

			*unite-source-attribute-async_gather_candidates*
async_gather_candidates	Function	(Optional)
			This function is called asynchronously in gathering
			candidates.  You can make use of this function to
			split time-consuming job into small jobs.
			|g:unite_update_time| is the default timing.  This
			function takes {args} and {context} as its parameter
			and returns a list of {candidate}.

			The specification of the parameters and the returned
			value is same as
			|unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates|.

					*unite-source-attribute-complete*
complete		Function	(Optional)
			This functions is called to complete the source
			argument of |:Unite|.  This function takes {args},
			{context}, {arglead}, {cmdline} and {cursorpos} as its
			parameter and returns a list of candidates.

						*unite-source-attribute-hooks*
hooks			Dictionary		(Optional)
			You may put hook functions in this dictionary in which
			the key is the position to hook and the value is the
			reference to the function to be called.  The following
			hook functions are defined:

			on_init		*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_init*
			Called just before returning to unite buffer after
			executing |:Unite| commands or calling |unite#start()|
			but executing |:UniteResume|.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameters.
			Note that you must be careful to select the function
			to call because the unite buffer is not still
			initialized in calling this hook function.

			on_syntax
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_syntax*
			Called after the unite buffer is initialized and
			syntax for each source is set but not called if
			|unite-source-attribute-syntax| is not set.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameters.
			Highlight configuration for each source is done by
			this function.

			Note: To get abbr head column, use
			"unite#get_current_unite().abbr_head".
			Example:
>
			syntax match uniteSource_FileMru_Time /(.*)/ contained containedin=uniteSource_FileMru
			highlight default link uniteSource_FileMru_Time Statement
<
			Note you must set the contained in of the same syntax
			name as for |unite-source-attribute-syntax|.

			on_close
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_close*
			Called after executing |<Plug>(unite_exit)| or closing
			the unite buffer following some command execution.
			This function takes {args} and {context} as its
			parameters.

			on_pre_filter
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_pre_filter*
			Called before the filters to narrow down the
			candidates.  This function takes {args} and {context}
			as its parameters.

			on_post_filter
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_post_filter*
			Called after the filters to narrow down the
			candidates.  This is used to set attributes.
			These filters are to avoid adversely affecting the
			performance.  This function takes {args} and {context}
			as its parameters.

			on_pre_init
				*unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_pre_init*
			Called before source is initialized.
			{args} is empty.
			Current source is set as "a:context.source" in
			{context}.
			You can dynamically initialize source by changing
			"a:context.source" in this function.

					*unite-source-attribute-action_table*
action_table		Dictionary		(Optional)
			Adds source's own action table.
			In this dictionary, the key is the kind and the value
			is the action table.  The specification of action
			table is same as |unite-kind-attribute-action_table|.
			With this dictionary, you can define original
			|unite-kind-attribute-action_table| for each kind in
			source's own context.
			For example:
>
			'action_table' : { 'buffer' : foo_action_table }
<
			means that foo_action_table is used for kind "buffer"
			in this source's context.
			You can use "*" for the key to match any kind.
			This is useful if you expect only one kind.  If no
			key-value pair is set, this dictionary is left empty.
			You can put action table without a corresponding key
			and it means the key is "*".
			For example, the following two are the same.
>
			'action_table' : foo_action_table
			'action_table' : { '*' : foo_action_table }
<
				*unite-source-attribute-default_action*
default_action		Dictionary		(Optional)
			Adds default action unique to the source.
			In this dictionary, the key is the kind and the value
			is the default action.
			If it's not given, the kind's default action is used.
			The default action can be in string format and
			it means the same as:
>
			'default_action' : { '*' : action_name}.
<
					*unite-source-attribute-default_kind*
default_kind		String			(Optional)
			Default kind in source candidates.
			If it's not given, the "common" is used.

alias_table		Dictionary		(Optional)
			Adds an alias table unique to the source.
			In this dictionary, the key is the kind and the value
			is the alias table.
			If the key is '*', it matches any kinds.
			Please refer to |unite-kind-attribute-action_table|
			for the specification of alias table.
			If no key-value is set, this dictionary is left
			empty.

					*unite-source-attribute-max_candidates*
max_candidates		Number		(Optional)
			The maximum number of candidates.

			This attribute is optional; if it is not given,
			0 is used as the default value.  This means

is_volatile		Number		(Optional)
			Whether the source recalculates the candidates
			everytime the input is changed.
			This attribute is optional.
			If it's not given, 0 is set as the default value.  In
			this case, candidates are cached in unite buffer and
			it does not call
			|unite-source-attribute-gather_candidates|
			repeatedly and the cache is available until the unite
			buffer is closed.  To cache longer, the source has no
			choice but to cache by itself.

			name is defined automatically by unite itself.
			If it's omitted, it's set to
			"uniteSource__(source name)".
			This is used to configure the source's own highlight.
			According to the unite's naming conversion to avoid
			the syntax name conflicted, use syntax name like
			"uniteSource__(source name)".  Configuration of
			highlight itself must use
			|unite-source-attribute-hooks-on_syntax|.

					*unite-source-attribute-filters*
filters			List		(Optional)
			The list of filters used by the source.  The elements
			are filter name or function reference (accepted

			immediately		(Number)
				If unite buffer is loaded from
				|unite-options-immediately|.

			is_redraw		(Number)
				If a user pressed |<Plug>(unite_redraw)| or
				invalidated cache after executed actions.
				Note: A user uses |<Plug>(unite_redraw)|
				mapping to remove cache files.

			is_invalidate		(Number)
				If An action disables a cache.  This is also 1

				Note: Unite searches kinds action from list
				tail.
				Ex: If you set kind attribute to ["file",
				"command"], "file" (default) actions will be
				overwritten by "command" action.  You should
				use source default action instead of kind.

			group			(String)	(Optional)
				The candidate group name.
				It is inserted in candidates automatically.
				Note: It is required and used when
				|unite-source-attribute-is_grouped| is non
				zero.

CREATE KIND					*unite-create-kind*

The files in autoload/unite/kinds are automatically loaded and it calls
unite#kinds#{kind_name}#define() whose return value is the kind.  Each return
value can be a list so you can return an empty list to avoid adding
undesirable kinds.  To add your own kinds dynamically, you can use
|unite#define_kind()|.

Note: To optimize load kind files, if "foo" kind name is detected, unite.vim
loads "autoload/unite/kinds/foo*.vim" files.  The kind file name must be kind
name prefix(Ex: foo).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KIND ATTRIBUTES					*unite-kind-attributes*

						*unite-kind-attribute-name*
name			String		(Required)
			The name of a kind.  It must consist of the
			following characters:
			- a-z
			- 0-9
			- _
			- /
			- - (Not head)

			For example:
			- "buffer" , "file_mru" and "view/git" are valid.
			- "BadOne", "!@#$%^&*()_[]{}-|" and "" are invalid.

					*unite-kind-attribute-default_action*
default_action		String		(Required)
			Specify default action name when executing
			|<Plug>(unite_do_default_action)|.  If this attribute
			is omitted, an error occurred.  But this hack is used
			in parent only actions.

					*unite-kind-attribute-action_table*
action_table		Dictionary		(Required)
			Adds an action table unique to the kind.  In this
			dictionary, the key is the action name and the value
			is one of dictionary attributes below.
			If the value is "nop", the actions are disabled.
			Note: "default" and "nop" names are keyword.  You
			cannot use them.
			Note: If name is "unite__new_candidate", it will be
			used for |<Plug>(unite_new_candidate)|.  It adds a
			candidate in current source.

			func			(Function)
				This function is called when executing
				actions.  This function takes {candidate}.
				If "is_selectable" attribute is "1",
				{candidate} are candidate list({candidates}).
				Note: This {candidate} is cached by unite, so
				you cannot modify it.  If you modify it, you
				must use |deepcopy()|.

			description		(String)	(Optional)
				The kind description string.

			is_quit			(Number)	(Optional)
				If this attribute is "1", unite buffer is
				closed before executing actions.  If this
				attribute is omitted, "1" is used.

				source cache when executing the action.  If
				this attribute is omitted, "0" is used.

			is_listed		(Number)	(Optional)

				unite sources.  If this attribute is omitted,
				"0" is used.

			is_tab			(Number)	(Optional)

				new tabpage.  If this attribute is omitted,
				"0" is used.

					*unite-kind-attribute-alias_table*
alias_table		Dictionary		(Optional)
			Adds an alias table unique to the kind.  In this
			dictionary, the key is the action name and the value
			is the overwrite action name.
			If the value is "nop", the action is disabled.

						*unite-kind-attribute-parents*
parents			List		(Optional)
			Specify parent list.  If this attribute is omitted,
			["common"] is used.
			Unite searches actions from list tail(head actions are
			overwritten).
			Note: Unite searches actions from parent list
			recursively.  You must check infinity loop.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPLICIT KIND				*unite-implicit-kind-for-a-source*

Unite can define actions in implicit kind.  The implicit kind name is
"source/{name}/{kind}".  The {name} is source name.  If the {kind} is "*", it
matches any kinds.

For example, if you want to add "delete" action in source "file", execute
below command.
>
	call unite#custom#action('source/file/*', 'delete', function('...'))
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTION RESOLUTION ORDER				*unite-action-resolution-order*

For example, if you fire actions from kind "file" candidate gathered by source
"file", unite searches actions by order below.
Note: kind "file" extends "openable" and "cdable" kind.

(1) Custom action table for kind "source/file/file".
(2) Default action table for kind "source/file/file".
(3) Custom action table for kind "source/file/*".
(4) Default action table for kind "source/file/*".
(5) Custom action table for kind "file".
(6) Default action table for kind "file".
(7) Custom action table for kind "cdable".
(8) Default action table for kind "cdable".
(9) Custom action table for kind "openable".
(10) Default action table for kind "openable".
(11) Custom action table for kind "common".
(12) Default action table for kind "common".

==============================================================================
CREATE FILTER					*unite-create-filter*

The files in autoload/unite/filters are automatically loaded and it calls
unite#filters#{filter_name}#define() whose return value is the filter.  Each
return value can be a list so you can return an empty list to avoid adding
undesirable filter.  To add your own filters dynamically, you can use
|unite#define_filter()|.

Note: To optimize load filter files, if "matcher_foo_bar" filter name is
detected, unite.vim loads "autoload/unite/filters/matcher_foo*.vim" files.
The filter file name must be filter name prefix(Ex: matcher_foo).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FAQ						*unite-faq*

Q: I want to delete files in unite buffer.

A: You can use below setting.  But this setting is dangerous.  You may delete
files by mistake.
>
	call unite#custom#alias('file', 'delete', 'vimfiler__delete')
<
Q: I want to input register values in insert mode.

A: You can use below mappings.
>
	inoremap <silent><expr> <C-z>
	\ unite#start_complete('register', { 'input': unite#get_cur_text() })
<
Q: Unite.vim breaks Window layout after quitting unite buffer.

A: You MUST NOT |:quit| or |:close| to quit unite buffer.
You must use |<Plug>(unite_exit)| or |<Plug>(unite_all_exit)|.

Q: I want to exit unite buffer after narrowing action in directory.

A: You should use |<Plug>(unite_all_exit)| instead of |<Plug>(unite_exit)|.

Q: How to make direct action (or choose action menu) to current file or given
path?

A: >
	call unite#do_candidates_action('some_action',
	\  unite#get_candidates([['file', expand('%')]]))
<
Q: unite.vim statusline conflicts with powerline.
https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline
https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline (deprecated)

A: You must set |g:unite_force_overwrite_statusline| to 0.
>
	let g:unite_force_overwrite_statusline = 0
<

And you must install below custom theme for powerline.

For powerline:

1. vim powerline local themes
https://github.com/zhaocai/linepower.vim

2. or checkout the powerline branch from @zhaocai with custom theme for
   unite.vim included edition
https://github.com/zhaocai/powerline

https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline/issues/470 (pull request)


For vim-powerline:

Q: I want to match candidates by filename.

A: >
  call unite#custom#source(
        \ 'buffer,file_rec/async,file_rec,file_mru', 'matchers',
        \ ['converter_tail', 'matcher_default'])
  call unite#custom#source(
        \ 'file_rec/async,file_rec,file_mru', 'converters',
        \ ['converter_file_directory'])
<

Q: I want to use fuzzy match.

A: Yes you can use |unite-filter-matcher_fuzzy|.
>
	call unite#custom#source('file,file/new,buffer,file_rec',
	\ 'matchers', 'matcher_fuzzy')
<
Note: Fuzzy matcher does not sort candidates.  If you want to sort by rank,
you can use "sorter_rank". But it is slow.
>
	call unite#filters#sorter_default#use(['sorter_rank'])
<
Q: I want to clear cache in candidates.

A: Please use |<Plug>(unite_redraw)|.

Q: I want to narrow automatically when other candidates are selected in insert
mode like ctrlp.vim.

A: This feature is already implemented.
Note: It requires Vim 7.3.418 or above.

Q: I want to run "split" action in insert mode by "<C-s>".

A: >
	autocmd FileType unite call s:unite_my_settings()
	function! s:unite_my_settings()
	  " Overwrite settings.
	  imap <silent><buffer><expr> <C-s>     unite#do_action('split')
	endfunction
<
Q: Unite adds unite buffer to jumplist automatically.

A: Sorry, but it is hard to fix. You should use |unite-source-jump| instead of
<C-i>/<C-o> mappings. It ignores unite buffer.

Note: In this issue, experimental settings are suggested. But I don't
recommend them.
https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/issues/278
Because:
1. Unite buffer name may be changed in later version.
2. You cannot use |:UniteResume| feature.
3. It has side effect. I cannot guarantee it works.

Q: unite.vim is too slow.

A: Use Vim 7.3.885 or above with |if_lua| feature; unite.vim gets faster.

Q: Support for existing vim settings like Commant-T plugin? Example,
'wildignore', 'grepprg', 'suffixes'...

A: No. Because it is hard to implement and it may conflict current unite
settings.

Q: I want the strength of the match to overpower the order in which I list
sources.

A: You should use |unite#custom#profile()|.
>
	call unite#custom#profile('files', 'filters', 'sorter_rank')
<

Q: Some files are not showing up in file_rec(/async) candidates. What's up
with that?

A: You need to update the cache. Press |<Plug>(unite_redraw)| (<C-l>) when
unite is focused.

Q: I want to toggle some sources like ctrlp.

A: You can use |<Plug>(unite_rotate_next_source)|.
If you use ":Unite file buffer" command to create unite buffer, it changes
source candidates order.

Initial order: file,buffer
First rotate: buffer,file
Next rotate: file,buffer

Q: Unite.vim file_rec/async command is not executable in Windows environment.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18343579/unite-vim-file-rec-async-command-is-not-executable

A: In Windows, you should not use file_rec/async source. It is too slow and
not easy to use. You should use file_rec source instead.

Q: file_rec and file_rec/async cannot find all files.
https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/issues/356
https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/issues/370
https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/issues/459

A: It is feature.  cf: |g:unite_source_rec_max_cache_files|.
And the default max candidates are limited. You can custom it by
|unite#custom#source()|. >
	let g:unite_source_rec_max_cache_files = 0
	call unite#custom#source('file_rec,file_rec/async',
	\ 'max_candidates', 0)

And you must clear previous cache in file_rec sources and wait until the cache
is completed("Directory traverse was completed" message is showed).
In large files directory, to make cache is slow. So I don't recommend it.
To clear cache, you must execute |<Plug>(unite_redraw)| in unite
buffer(in default it is mapped to <C-l>).

Note: |unite-options-sync| may be useful. It blocks Vim until the cache is
completed.

Q: I want to toggle preview window when I press "p" key.

A: >
	autocmd FileType unite call s:unite_my_settings()
	function! s:unite_my_settings()
	    nnoremap <silent><buffer><expr> p
	          \ empty(filter(range(1, winnr('$')),
	          \ 'getwinvar(v:val, "&previewwindow") != 0')) ?
	          \ unite#do_action('preview') : ":\<C-u>pclose!\<CR>"
	endfunction

Q: file_rec/async source does not look .gitignore using ag.
https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/issues/398

A: It is feature. file_rec/async does not ignore in .gitignore files by
default.  You must change |g:unite_source_rec_async_command| value and
re-create cache by |<Plug>(unite_redraw)| mapping.

Q: matcher_fuzzy not used by ":UniteWithBufferDir file" command.
https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/issues/418

A: It is feature. See |g:unite_matcher_fuzzy_max_input_length|.

Q: mru source is slow in large mru files.
https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/issues/422

A: You can set |g:unite_source_mru_do_validate| to 0. It is faster. But unite
does not validate mru files.

Q: I don't want to get input lag like ctrlp.vim.

A: You can use |unite-options-sync|. But unite.vim may block your Vim in long
time.

Q: I want to restrict the files I see to the current project or the current
directory.
https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim/issues/456

A: You should use |unite-filter-matcher_project_files|. >
  call unite#custom#source(
        \ 'file_mru', 'matchers',
        \ ['matcher_project_files', 'matcher_fuzzy'])
<
Q: I want to disable mru source.

A: You should set g:loaded_unite_source_mru option. >
  let g:loaded_unite_source_mru = 1
